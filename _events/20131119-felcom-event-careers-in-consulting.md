**ROOM CHANGE TO MASUR AUDITORIUM, BLD 10**

Does a fast-paced life excite you? Are you skilled at analyzing problems
and developing strategies? Would you like to multitask and ensure the
success of your collaborator/client? If you do, then this is the career
panel for you! The FelCom Career Development subcommittee has put
together a fantastic panel of biomedical researchers who have
transitioned to strategic consulting. They use their scientific
knowledge and analytical abilities to develop strategies that solve
their client\'s challenges. The panelists will discuss how they started
consulting, their day-to-day routine, likes and dislikes. Come and join
the discussion in our \"Careers in Consulting\" panel to see if
strategic consulting is right for you!

This event is sponsored by Felcom.
