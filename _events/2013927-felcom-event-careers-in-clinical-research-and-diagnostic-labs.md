Are you hoping to be a part of something extraordinary? Are you
creative, passionate, entrepreneurial and willing to transfer your basic
wet-lab knowledge to directly help patients? For-profit and non-profit
clinical laboratories are established in response to the community's
need for a local, high quality clinical diagnosis, and you can be an
active part of it! Professionals at these laboratories use sensitive and
specific chemical and molecular diagnostic techniques to detect and
identify biomarkers at the most basic level; common applications include
medical diagnoses, establishing prognosis, monitoring the course of
disease, and selecting optimal therapies. Molecular methods are also
used for both forensic and non-forensic identification. This panel will
share their perspectives about their daily responsibilities at their
current positions, what types of positions exist, and what fellows can
do to transition into the field. This event is sponsored by the FELCOM
Career Development Committee.
