*December is a month of many holidays - Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa,
Boxing Day, Omisoka, Geeta Jayanti and Winter Solstice celebrations, to
name a few.  Rituals are often part of these special times, which we
often share with family and friends.  Many of us can\'t engage in these
rituals like we usually do because of the pandemic, but it can be
helpful to mark them in whatever way we can. We\'re hoping you will come
and share your favorite holiday ritual with others during Wellness
Wednesday and, in this way, embrace what\'s meaningful for you during
this season. *
