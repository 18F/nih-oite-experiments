Many of us hold deeply ingrained beliefs about ourselves that are simply
not true, and they become a big part of our "personal story." 
Unfortunately, the more we identify with and tell ourselves this story,
the more it plays out in our actual lives -- becoming a self-fulfilling
prophecy.  Come to *Wellness Wednesday* this week to talk with others
about how to **Edit Your Personal Story** and open yourself to a more
realistic and positive narrative about yourself and your life.
