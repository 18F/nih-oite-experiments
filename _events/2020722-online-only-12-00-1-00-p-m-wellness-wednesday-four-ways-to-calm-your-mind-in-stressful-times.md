There is no such thing as a "stress-free" life (or day or sometimes even
hour...).  And when we're studying for the MCAT/GRE or applying to
medical/graduate school or engaged in a job search *on top* of our usual
tasks, life can begin to feel really out of control. (Add in a pandemic
just to make things even more challenging...) In response to these
demands, we often just over-schedule ourselves, push harder, drink more
coffee, and hope things will get better -- but most often, there are
just new demands waiting for us around the corner.  So come to *Wellness
Wednesday* this week and learn some ways to **Calm Your Mind** (and
thus, your body) when life is overwhelming.
