Please join this warm and welcoming group of NIH trainees of color to
enjoy a safe space. Let's share our unique cultures, challenges, and
experiences to help you feel connected and supported during your time as
an NIH trainee. Whether you are feeling isolated, unsure or just want to
expand your community, this group is for you.  Come join us wherever you
are in your personal journey to build and strengthen connections among
trainees of color. This session is open to trainees at all levels
(postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Wayne
Marshall in Building 2/Room 2W15.  The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for
the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you
come late or leave early, than not come at all.
