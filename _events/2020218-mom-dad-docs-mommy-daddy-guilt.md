**Mommy/Daddy Guilt**: In a nationwide survey 96% of parents reported
feeling guilty about some aspect of parenting. Issues ranging from the
amount of time they spend with their kids, yelling at their little ones,
work choices they need to make, all the way to the kind of diapers they
use. Experts say guilt can actually serve as a helpful tool --- as long
as you don\'t take it too far. Staying in control of the guilt, rather
than letting the guilt control us, is the topic of this month's meeting.
We will discuss why we feel guilty and what we can do to keep the guilt
in check!

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">What is
Mom-Dad-Docs? The mission of this group is to provide a supportive
community for postdoc, clinical fellow and graduate student parents at
the NIH. This group will discuss and address issues and challenges of
juggling parenthood and a scientific career at the same time. Monthly
meetings will alternate between in-person discussions and webinars to
provide postdoc/clinical fellow/graduate student parents a chance to
meet while learning more about topics such as time management, career,
and general parenting questions. Guest speakers will present topics,
insights and resources. The Mom-Dad-Docs group welcomes all male and
female post-docs, clinical fellows, trainees, graduate students and
mentors with children (or thinking about having children). </span>
