During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions, dedicated OITE staff members will
answer questions about applying to graduate programs, writing personal
statements, and other general questions. We are going to meet
bi-weekly.  These sessions are not consecutive, so you can attend one or
more, and as many as you want. 

If you are interested, please register in advance, as we will be sending
the zoom link to all registrants by 10:00 am on the day of the session. 

NOTE: This event is for the current NIH Postbacs only.
