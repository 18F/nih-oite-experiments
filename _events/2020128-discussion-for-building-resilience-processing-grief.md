We experience grief when we lose something or someone we care about. 
Sometimes life throws us unexpected changes that derail our plans. 
Maybe your career path is not working out like you had planned.  Maybe
you didn\'t get an interview with your dream school. Grief is a natural
emotional response when we experience a significant life change or
loss.   Even a positive life event can cause grief - - you may be happy
about moving on to an exciting new opportunity, but also grieving about
leaving NIH.  The process of grieving is uniquely individual and may
include feelings such as shock, anger, sadness, depression, and even
guilt.  Sometimes these feelings conflict - - you may be sad and angry
at the same time.    Each person experiences grief in a unique way and
on their own timeline.  Let\'s talk about processing grief and moving
forward. This session is open to trainees at all levels (postbac, grad,
and postdoc).

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than not attend at all.
