Journaling is a great way to connect with yourself, work through
challenges, express inner thoughts and emotions, and support your
goals.  Research shows that it has both physical and mental health
benefits, including better immune functioning, decrease in blood
pressure, better sleep, decrease in depression and anxiety, and improved
working memory.  Come experience how journaling can be helpful to you at
this week's *Wellness Wednesday*! **Please bring a journal/paper and
pen!**<strong>  </strong>**Feel Free to bring your lunch -- microwave is
available!**
