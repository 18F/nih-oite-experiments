medicine and working in a dynamic and challenging environment, perhaps
you should consider a career at a Think Tank. Think Tanks (also commonly
called Policy Institutes) conduct research and advocate for public
policy in areas including political strategy, social issues, the
economy, science and technology. Many think tanks are non-profit
organizations, while others are funded by governments, advocacy groups,
businesses or private individuals. Their staff pen op-ed articles,
appear on television programs, testify in congressional hearings, advise
politicians, build coalitions on policy issues, and shape public
debates. In short, Think Tanks do the thinking and analysis that
policy-makers do not have the time to do themselves.  Additionally,
Think Tanks can serve as incubators for innovative ideas. A panel of
speakers from various Think Tank organizations will discuss how they
moved into the industry, their job responsibilities, and other advice
for following this career choice.  Please join us to learn more!</span>
