<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The recent months have been very
difficult for everyone.  Even in the best of times, juggling all of our
work, career and life responsibilities is challenging even when things
are mostly going well. Now there are new challenges every day.  When we
hit a bump, in one area or another, we may lose focus and our sense of
calm. Navigating challenges can be even more difficult in the context of
excessive anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD/ADD, ASD or other mental health
conditions. On top of the challenge itself, it can be difficult dealing
with stigma and finding safe places to talk things through. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
