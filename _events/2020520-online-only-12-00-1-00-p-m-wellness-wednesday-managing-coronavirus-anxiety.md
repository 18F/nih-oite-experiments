Most of us are experiencing heightened levels of anxiety as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.  One definition of anxiety is \"an unrealized
fear that thrives in uncertainty and other vague circumstances\" - this
certainly applies to our current situation! Although we cannot directly
control the virus or the external circumstances surrounding it, how we
respond to our anxiety can really make a difference for our wellbeing. 
Come join us on Zoom this Wellness Wednesday, to talk with others about
ways to **\"Manage Coronavirus Anxiety.\"**
