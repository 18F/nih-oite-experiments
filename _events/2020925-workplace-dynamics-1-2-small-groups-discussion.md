Take a deeper dive into the material from Workplace Dynamics 1-2:
Building Self-Awareness. In small groups we will discuss how we
communicate with others, times when our communication styles got in the
way, and how to improve workplace relationships moving forward.

For this session, please attend the workshop on Sept 18. Additionally,
any previous attendees of Workplace Dynamic 1-2: Building Self-Awareness
are also welcome to these small group discussions.

Register here, and we will share the zoom link the day of the event.
