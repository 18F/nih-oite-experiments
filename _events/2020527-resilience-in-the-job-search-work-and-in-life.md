Finding ways to stay positive, optimistic and productive are important
components to being an effective job seeker.  This workshop focuses on
building confidence during your search, enhancing optimism and
resilience, and challenging individuals to find value in the experiences
that don't go as planned.  Strategies and resources for maximizing
successes, reducing uncertainty and minimizing disappointments in the
job search, at work, and in all areas of life will be shared.
