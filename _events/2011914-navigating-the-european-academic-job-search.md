 The Visiting Fellows Committee\'s \"Science Voices from Home\" program
is organizing a special event on navigating your European based academic
job search. Join us for an informative session and Q&amp;A with a panel
of experts and former fellows as we discuss some of the major funding
opportunities and career development strategies as well as hear from
former NIH fellows who have successfully made the transition to Europe
as Principal Investigators. The panel for this event will include
Izabella Zandberg from EURAXESS Links USA, former fellows Dr. Karin
Lore, now with the Karolinska Institutet, and Dr. Grzegorz Woszczek, now
with King\'s College London, and Dr. Frank Neumann, senior postdoc at
the Rockefeller University New York.  Sponsored by the NIH Visiting
Fellows Committee.

For questions regarding the event, please contact Thos Geiger of the
