Last week\'s Wellness Wednesday focused on \"Living with the New
Normal.\"  This week\'s discussion group will help us lean into this a
bit more.  Using Brooke Anderson\'s article posted on the online
*Greater Good* *Magazine* out of the University of Berkeley, we will
explore **6 daily questions** to ask ourselves as we move through these
days of teleworking and physical distancing.  Bring your lunch, **a pen
and paper**, and yourselves to this lunchtime discussion group to talk
with others about ways to practice good self-care in the midst of this
challenging time.  We\'ll meet on Zoom (just click on the link below a
couple of minutes before noon and we\'ll be waiting) - Hope to \"see\"
you there!
