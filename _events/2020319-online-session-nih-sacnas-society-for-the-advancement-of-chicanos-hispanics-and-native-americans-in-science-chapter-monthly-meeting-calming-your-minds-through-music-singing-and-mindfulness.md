The NIH-SACNAS Chapter (Society for the Advancement of
Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science) would like to invite
you to their March meeting. This month will focus on wellness. Are you
feeling bogged down by studying, research and time crunches? We can help
by: **"Calming your Minds through Music, Singing and Mindfulness"**. 
This event will be a great opportunity to develop self-care
competencies, disconnect from lab, and meet other fellows. Please join
Julia Jarvis, MDiv, OITE Wellness Advisor, who will be leading this
webinar.
