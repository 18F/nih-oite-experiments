Do you have a suggestion for improving efficiency in your lab but lack
the confidence to bring it to the attention of your PI? Do you need
additional resources for your experiments or time off for an important
family activity but don\'t know how to ask?  Are you afraid to mention
the fact that you are having major difficulty dealing with one of your
lab mates? 

This session will help you to explore strategies for communicating your
needs in a variety of situations. Learn how to be more assertive, to
speak up for yourself, and how to decide when to speak up and when not
to.  

A zoom link will be provided to those who register.
