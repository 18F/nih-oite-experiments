**Back by popular demand!  **Mindfulness Painting is a creative practice
of using paint, paper and a brush to relieve your stress, bring your
focus to the present moment, and ignite your creativity. It\'s also a
great practice for releasing critical self-judgment and perfectionism.
This special offering to NIH trainees and fellows will take place on
**Monday**{::}**, September 23rd**, from **3:00 - 5:00 p.m.** in the
OITE Conference Room (**Bldg. 2, Rm. 2W15**). No artistic ability
needed, so leave your inner art critic at home! **Space is limited so
sign up now!**

**Because space is limited, please be sure you will be able to attend so
you don\'t take space from someone else (thanks!). **
