This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac
program.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the link will be
distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv announcements. If you need the link
immediately please email OITE@nih.gov. 

Holidays are often a time when we connect with loved ones, celebrate
culture, and rejuvenate. However, due to current events or
individual circumstances, maybe your plans to celebrate with loved ones
have been cancelled, you are currently residing far away from those you
care about, or your places of worship have been closed.  It is quite
common to experience changes in mood when feeling physically,
emotionally, or spiritually isolated from your families, friends, and
communities. Join us to build connections, celebrate your traditions,
and be present with others. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Liann
Seiter. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space
to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
