<span style="font-size: 10pt;">So many of our postbacs are currently
worried about MCATs, GREs, and other standardized tests that are
gateways to the next step. For some of us, no matter what strategies we
try we are left feeling that we are not good enough. For others, we know
we would benefit from accommodations but stress around the request
process hold us back. And it is hard not to feel that our score defines
us as a person, even though we know we are so much more than our
performance on this one test.  Let\'s talk about wellness
strategies to maintain a healthy balance as you tackle these
challenges.   Building your resiliency and self-care skills now will
help you to successfully navigate through periods of growth, and will
serve you well throughout your academic and career path. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner.  The resiliency group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive
methods to build resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you can't
join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We would
rather you come late or leave early, than not attend at all.    </span>
