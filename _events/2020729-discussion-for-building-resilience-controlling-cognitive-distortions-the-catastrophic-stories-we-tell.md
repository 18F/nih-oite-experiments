<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

inaccurate, which often become our habitual way of interacting with the
world. These false beliefs are usually self-limiting and self-defeating
and result in considerable emotional turmoil and pain.  They may lead to
overly negative thoughts about a current or future situation and can
lead us to take actions that are against our best interests and derail
our goals. Let's talk about how to recognize these negative thoughts and
make positive changes. </span>

Seiter. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space
to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.</span>
