usually do during this time. And plans for celebrating the holiday
season in December are also affected.Â  This Wellness Wednesday will be
an opportunity to share your thoughts and feelings about these altered
times we\'re living in, as well as talk about how to bring s*{::}*ome
positivity and connection to our lives - despite the pandemic!*
