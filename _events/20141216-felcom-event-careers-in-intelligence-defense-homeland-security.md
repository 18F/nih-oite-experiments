<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17.8329830169678px;">When
biomedical researchers think of applying their research, most think of a
clinical setting, to cure or treat a disease. However, this research and
the knowledge associated with it also play a fundamental role in
national defense. Recent news events, like Ebola, and potential threats,
like bioweapons, show the need for experts to plan countermeasures and
execute informed responses. A panel of speakers involved in national
security will discuss their work, how they got their jobs, and other
aspects of their careers. Please join us to learn more.    </span>

This event is sponsored by the NIH FelCom Career Development
Subcommittee.
