The Mom-Dad-Docs team would like to invite you to our weekly virtual
lunch on Tuesdays. 

Stay connected with other parent trainees and join us for a virtual
lunch. Share a meal, chat, de-stress, and remember you have a community
of Mom-Dad-Docs you can stay connected to while you telework.

Everyone is welcome! 

Please register for this event to receive the login in information for
the meetings, which will be held every Tuesday from noon - 1:00 pm.

*What is Mom-Dad-Docs?* The mission of this group is to provide a
supportive community for postdoc, clinical fellow and graduate student
parents at the NIH. This group will discuss and address issues and
challenges of juggling parenthood and a scientific career at the same
time. Monthly meetings will alternate between in-person discussions and
webinars to provide postdoc/clinical fellow/graduate student parents a
chance to meet while learning more about topics such as time management,
career, and general parenting questions. Guest speakers will present
topics, insights and resources. The Mom-Dad-Docs group welcomes all male
and female post-docs, clinical fellows, trainees, graduate students and
mentors with children (or thinking about having children).
