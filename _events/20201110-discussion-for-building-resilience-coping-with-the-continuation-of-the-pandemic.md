This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

As we enter the next phase of the pandemic, winter is coming and that
will bring colder temperatures and shorter days. As the season changes,
it may be more difficult for many of us to find opportunities to
socialize and to spend time outdoors.  It is more important than ever
that we continue to find ways to connect with others, recharge
ourselves, and maintain our resilience. This discussion will focus on
how we can cope with and find solace and support in this time of
continued stress. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates. 
The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we encourage you
to still attend.
