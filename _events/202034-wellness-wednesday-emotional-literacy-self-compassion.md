The third quadrant of OITE\'s holistic health model
(***body-mind-heart-spirit***) focuses on emotional wellbeing.
 Emotional wellbeing involves two interrelated areas - knowing how to
skillfully manage our emotions and knowing how to skillfully interact in
relationships.  In this week\'s *Wellness Wednesday,* we will discuss
ways to become **\"emotionally literate\"** (the ability to identify,
manage, and express our emotions) and how to
cultivate **\"self-compassion\" **(the ability to befriend ourselves,
which helps us interact better with others, as well).  **Feel free to
bring your lunch -- microwave is available!**
