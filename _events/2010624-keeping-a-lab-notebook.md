The laboratory notebook is a critical document of the methods of and
data from the experiments you perform.  Maintaining a clear, concise
record of the work you do in the lab this summer is essential because it
is this information that will help you plan and trouble shoot your
experiments, that could be used to generate figures for a manuscript,
and that may be a starting point for a colleague\'s project after you
leave.  Being so important, how do you know what information you should
record?  How do you organize your data so that it can easily be found? 
How often should you write up and review your data?  This workshop will
address these questions and more to help you generate a complete and
thorough notebook and get as much out of the process as you can.
