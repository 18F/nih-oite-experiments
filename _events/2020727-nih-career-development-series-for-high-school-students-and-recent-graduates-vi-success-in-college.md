The transition to college can be stressful. You are leaving behind your
school, friends, family, and home, and going off to explore a new place,
make new friends, learn new things, and set your own priorities. This
workshop will provide you with skills for networking, choosing
experiences, finding mentors, and using resources.

Note: Students who attend at least five workshops will be eligible to
receive a certificate of completion.
