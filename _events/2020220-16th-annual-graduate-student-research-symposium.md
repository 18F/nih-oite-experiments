Every year, the NIH Graduate Student Research Symposium exhibits the
excellence of scientific research completed by the graduate students at
the National Institutes of Health. The day will begin with over 60
students competing in a scientific elevator pitch competition.  We have
over 140 students presenting posters, representing the various
Institutes &amp; Centers across the NIH.  We will also have four student
talks, which will reflect both the diversity and the depth of scientific
work done by the graduate students at the NIH.  This year, we are
honored to have Dr. Todd Kashdan, Professor of Psychology and Senior
Scientist at the Center for the Advancement of Well-Being at George
Mason University, as our keynote speaker.  Dr. Kashdan has authored
numerous books about the psychology of success and is a world-recognized
authority on well-being, strengths, social relationships, stress and
anxiety.  Also, we will present awards to three outstanding mentors who
were nominated by their students in recognition of the guidance and
unconditional support they have provided to their graduate students.
Finally, we will end our event with a ceremony to recognize those
students who have graduated from their respective partnership
universities in the past year and wish them continued success.
