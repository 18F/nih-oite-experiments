Career planning and job searches during the best of times can take an
enormous amount of time and energy, with many ups and downs throughout.
The pandemic has increased the complexity of this already stressful
process. While we frequently talk about the nuts and bolts of the career
exploration and the job search process, we don\'t usually talk about how
stressful and emotionally challenging the process can be. A common
element of navigating the challenges of job searching is using
resources, and developing your stress management, and self-care skills. 
Whether you are at the beginning of your job search or in the final
negotiations, it is always a good time to build resiliency and self-care
skills that will help you successfully navigate through periods of
transition and change.

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates.
The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
