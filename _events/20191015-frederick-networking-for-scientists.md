**This session is in Frederick, MD**

Networking, including both online (important when you don\'t live
close) and in-person networking, is an important component of successful
career building. A second key component is managing your network. We
will dive deeper into managing networks, covering topics that include
identifying career advocates, interacting with colleagues, and building
meaningful long-term communication. Additionally, we will discuss how to
building your mentoring network.

This session will prepare you for the FDC mentor mixer later in October.
