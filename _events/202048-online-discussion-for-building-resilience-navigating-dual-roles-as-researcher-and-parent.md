Zoom.  The meeting link will be distributed via the NIH Trainee
Listservs.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Balancing dual roles as scientist and
parent can be challenging. Your research often demands time and
attention that can make it difficult to be available to your family in
the way that you want to be. The kids get sick, your partner is out of
town, your experiments can't wait until tomorrow, or you are facing a
deadline on a submission. Everyday situations like these can overwhelm
us and make it difficult to stay focused on the things that matter. This
discussion will focus on navigating these dual roles, and offer
encouragement for staying focused in your research, engaging in good
self-care and being present when you are with others.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
staff member, Denise Saunders, PhD. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
