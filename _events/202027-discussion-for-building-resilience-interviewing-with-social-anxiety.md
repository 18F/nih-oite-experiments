<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Interviewing for
schools and jobs is stressful under the best of circumstances, and it
can be extremely so for those of us with social anxiety.  Managing
social anxiety, which can often present throughout the interview process
as you interact with a multitude of new people can be difficult.  Please
join us to talk about common anxiety triggers, the use of healthy coping
to build resilience against stress, and tools to combat unhelpful
coping, such as avoidance and procrastination.    </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Please join
us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Laurie Chaikind McNulty.
This resiliency group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive methods to build resilience and self-care
skills.    Even if you can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage
you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave early, than
not attend at all.   </span>
