For many of us, "relaxation" means zoning out in front of our favorite
electronic device at the end of a stressful day. But research shows that
this does little to reduce the damaging effects of stress. (And with
many of working online right now, the last thing we need is more
\"screen time\" at the end of the day.)Â  To effectively combat stress,
we need to learn how to activate the body\'s natural<em>
<strong>relaxation response</strong></em>. This week's Wellness
Wednesday will provide information on the multiple benefits of the
relaxation response and ways to make it part of your self-care regimen.
