<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Talking about your science can be fun and
exciting, but it can also be a source of anxiety.  You may have concerns
about making a mistake, how your PI will react to your presentation, or
what your peers will think.  Presenting your work in a public setting
can be stressful, and the loud, crowded environment of a poster session
can be difficult to navigate.  In addition, imposter fears can easily
present themselves when we compare our work to that of others.  Join us
for a discussion about strategies to deal with this often stressful, but
necessary, aspect of our lives as scientists. This session is open to
trainees of all levels (postbac, grad, postdoc). </span>

welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive
methods to build resilience and self-care skills.  Please join us for a
discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner.  Even if you
can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We
would rather you come late or leave early, than not attend at all.
