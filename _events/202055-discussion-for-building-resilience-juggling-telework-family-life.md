distributed via the NIH Trainee Listservs.  

Working from home is challenging. When we throw in navigating distance
learning with our kids, managing our own emotions (and theirs), and
tackling day-to-day household tasks, it seems nearly impossible.
Currently, any sort of work/life balance seems unattainable, and many of
us are struggling to remain productive while managing current stressors.
Join us as we process the challenges of our current situation and
examine ways to cope with the stress of working from home with our
children. 

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin
Futrovsky Gates. The resiliency group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive methods to build
resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you can't join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend. <span style="font-family:
