 Working with colleagues from around the world provides a great
opportunity to learn about other cultures. But developing relationships
with people from other backgrounds can sometimes seem challenging. This
presentation aims to increase inter-cultural understanding in order to
help people work together more effectively.  The target audience
includes people from the US, those who have been in the US for years,
and those who have arrived more recently, anyone who wants to learn more
about understanding others. Topics covered include non-verbal
communication, speech patterns, and formation of perceptions.
