*Culture plays a major role on health and wellness. It can shape our
perceptions, beliefs and approaches to wellness. Additionally, culture
can serve as a determinant of health outcomes. Interested in exploring
how your family culture, place(s) of origin, race/ethnicity, or
spiritual beliefs shape your health and wellness? Join us for this
week's Wellness Wednesday!*
