The European Union encourages and promotes the mobility of researchers.
It welcomes researchers from outside the European Union who are
interested in spending part of their careers in an European country.
There are programs at national and EU level to promote such
international mobility from early-stage researcher to
recognized/established researcher and beyond. This seminar will
introduce the opportunities offered by the European Research Council and
Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions.They are open to researchers from all
over the world regardless of their nationality.

**Agenda**

* Short introduction by Director for International Cooperation at the
  European Commission, Cristina Russo
* 30 mins:  Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) (opportunities mainly
  for graduate students &amp; postdocs &amp; US institutions to host a
  postdoc from Europe) for researchers ready to launch their first
  research group or consolidate their existing group and for researchers
  advanced in their careers.
* 30 mins:  European Research Council (ERC) Grants (opportunities mainly
  for postdocs and more experienced researchers)

Some Background Information:</span>

*Horizon 2020  
*Horizon 2020 is the European Union\'s Framework Programme for Research
and Innovation, with a budget of €77 billion between 2014 and 2020 to
support scientifically-excellent research, innovation, and technological
development, through collaborative research projects as well as grants
and fellowships to individuals. It is open to the world, so US
researchers are very welcome to get involved. This event will provide an
insight into the opportunities for US researchers to cooperate with
European partners and the funding schemes available to those interested
in spending part of their career in Europe.

*Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions
([https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/][2]):  
*The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions provide significant support for
international and intersectoral research mobility and career
development, both for researchers inside the European Union and
externally. The program includes activities such as initial training of
researchers, support for lifelong training and career development,
transfer of knowledge and networking via actions including individual
fellowships, innovative training networks, and research and innovation
staff exchange.

*European Research Council ([https://erc.europa.eu][3]):  
*The ERC funds investigator-driven research at the frontiers of
knowledge in all areas of science and technology. Particular emphasis is
being placed on emerging and fast-growing fields at the frontiers of
knowledge, and on cross-disciplinary research. The ERC also attracts top
researchers from anywhere in the world to come to Europe. 

Every effort will be made to ensure that the event is as interactive as
possible. It will be an ideal opportunity to explore possible career
options in Europe with experts who know the programs very well.
