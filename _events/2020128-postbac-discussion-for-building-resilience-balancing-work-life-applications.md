<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Does balancing your work
responsibilities, personal life, and application process sometimes feel
like a juggling act?  Your family and friends may be supportive and
still not understand what you do at work, why you work so hard, and why
certain projects or deadlines are so important. Building your resiliency
and self-care skills will help you to successfully navigate through
these periods of transition and change, and will serve you well
throughout your academic and career path.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The resiliency group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive methods to
build resilience and self-care skills.  Please join us for a discussion
with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. Even if you can\'t stay for
the entire hour, we still encourage you to attend.  </span>
