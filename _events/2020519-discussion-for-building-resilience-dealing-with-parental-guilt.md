In a nationwide survey 96% of parents reported feeling guilty about some
aspect of parenting. Issues ranging from the amount of time they spend
with their kids, yelling at their little ones, work choices they need to
make, all the way to the kind of diapers they use. In the current
pandemic, we are over stressed and these feelings are amplified. Yet
experts say guilt can actually serve as a helpful tool. So how do we not
be overwhelmed by our feelings of guilt? Staying in control that we
don\'t take it too far. Staying in control of the guilt, rather than
letting the guilt control us, is the topic of this meeting. We
will discuss why we feel guilty and what we can do to keep the guilt in
check!

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.
