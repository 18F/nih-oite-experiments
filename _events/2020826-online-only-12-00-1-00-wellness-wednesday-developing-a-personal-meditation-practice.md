Research shows that a regular meditation practice has many physical and
mental health benefits and it is being especially recommended by many
wellness experts during this time of COVID-19 and heightened societal
unrest.  Have you thought about starting meditation, but not sure how to
begin? Have you attended group meditation sessions, but don't know how
to take it home?  Do you have a personal practice, but would like to
deepen it or make it more consistent?  Then come to this week's
*Wellness Wednesday* on **"Developing a Personal Meditation Practice"**
when we will talk about some ways to bring this self-care practice into
your life.
