Journaling is a great way to connect with yourself, work through
challenges, express inner thoughts and emotions, and support your
goals. Research shows that it has both physical and mental health
benefits, including better immune functioning, decrease in blood
pressure, better sleep, decrease in depression and anxiety, and improved
working memory. It can be particularly helpful in this challenging time
of COVID-19. Come join Dr. Sharon Milgram at this week\'s Wellness
Wednesday to explore how journaling can be helpful to you! **Please
bring a journal/paper and pen!**{: data-stringify-type="bold"}
