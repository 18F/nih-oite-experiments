During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the pre-medical team will answer
questions about the medical school application, AMCAS and MCAT updates,
and other general questions. We are going to be meeting every other
week. Questions about MCAT prep strategies and Personal Statements will
be discussed in separate sessions (see OITE upcoming events). These
sessions are not consecutive, so you can attend one or more, and as many
as you want.Â
