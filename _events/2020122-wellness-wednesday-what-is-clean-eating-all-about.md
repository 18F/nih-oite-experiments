We hear a lot these days about "clean eating" -- on blogs, in magazines,
even in restaurants.  But what is this way of eating really about?
 (Hint -- it's not about whether your food is clean or dirty!)  At this
week's *Wellness Wednesday*, we'll talk about the health benefits of
**clean eating** and some ways to achieve it in our busy lives.  We'll
also talk about how this approach to food is not just about a way of
eating, but also a way of living that ultimately benefits the planet as
well. **Feel free to bring your lunch -- microwave is available!**
