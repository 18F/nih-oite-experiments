Research suggests that meaningful social connections are as essential to
our wellbeing as food, water, and shelter.  Recently, social scientists
are saying that we are in the midst of a "loneliness epidemic," with
rates of loneliness doubling over the past 50 years - and this has only
been exacerbated by the current health crisis.  How do we foster **true
connection and belonging** in our lives when loved ones often live far
away, many of us are still working at home or working alone in shifts at
the lab, and work and other responsibilities can sometimes leave little
energy for reaching out to others? This week's Wellness Wednesday will
explore this challenge through an open discussion about "Connecting and
Belonging."
