<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Transitions can be challenging,
particularly transitioning back to campus after months of telework. You
may be experiencing mixed emotions about your return to campus and
wondering how quickly research progress will occur. As you return to
work it's important to consider both your emotions and your thoughts.
Setting realistic goals, being patient and staying focused and positive
will be helpful. Consider joining us as we discuss the ups and downs of
the transition back to work. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Denise Saunders. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
