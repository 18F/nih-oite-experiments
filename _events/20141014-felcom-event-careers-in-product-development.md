<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17.8329830169678px;">Industry
basic research is often thought of as upstream innovation and the final
product is a drug, device, or some other novel technological
advancement. This panel of experts from different companies and
backgrounds will discuss careers in product development, what steps led
each of the panelists to their current role, and their current job
responsibilities.  </span>

Whether you are interested in continuing to do bench side research, or
perhaps, stay in a research setting but step away from the bench, join
our discussion with the panelists to learn more about the different
opportunities for PhD scientists in industry at various points in the
product development pipeline.

This event is sponsored by the FelCom Career Development subcommittee.
