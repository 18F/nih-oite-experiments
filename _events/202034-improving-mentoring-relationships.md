Your success as an NIH trainee depends on having a collaborative
learning relationship with your primary research supervisor(s) and
cultivating strong mentor relationships, inside and outside of the
research group. This workshop will explore the relationship between
trainees and research mentors/supervisors with the goal of providing
strategies for improving communication and interpersonal interactions.
The workshop will help participants clarify what they need from their
supervisors and mentors and how to ensure that they get what they  need.
