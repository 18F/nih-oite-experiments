Are you interested in leveraging your skills research and scientific
communication to land a role in the pharmaceutical industry? Have you
ever considered working in medical affairs? Please join this career
development seminar to learn more about becoming a Medical Science
Liaison! Medical science liaisons work with leading physicians and
researchers to provide input on upcoming treatments using relevant
scientific and clinical data. To learn about the broad range of careers
in this field, we invite scientists from small and large pharmaceutical
sectors who have successfully transitioned from the laboratory. The
panelists will share their stories about career transition, day-to-day
experiences and challenges in different settings. After the
presentations, our panelists will be happy to answer questions and
provide career advice on how to become a medical science liaison. Come
and join us to learn more about those fascinating careers and find your
future aspirations. This event is sponsored by FELCOM's Career
Development Subcommittee.
