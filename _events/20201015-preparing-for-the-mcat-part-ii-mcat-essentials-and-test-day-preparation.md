This workshop will discuss MCAT logistics/policies, how and when to
schedule full rehearsals, and when to use various resources. 
Additionally, we will discuss test-day specifics, and tips and advice
about how to best prepare in the days just prior to the test.

Succeeding on standardized tests often depends on more than knowing the
material. Test takers must be able to remain calm and carefully consider
different approaches to the test, including using strategies for
managing emotions and physiology to maximize test performance.
