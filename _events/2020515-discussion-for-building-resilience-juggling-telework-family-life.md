<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

distance learning with our kids, managing our own emotions (and theirs),
and tackling day-to-day household tasks, it seems nearly impossible.
Currently, any sort of work/life balance seems unattainable, and many of
us are struggling to remain productive while managing current stressors.
Join us as we process the challenges of our current situation and
examine ways to cope with the stress of working from home with our
children. </span>

Advisor, Erin Futrovsky Gates. The resiliency group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive methods to
build resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you can't join us for
the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
