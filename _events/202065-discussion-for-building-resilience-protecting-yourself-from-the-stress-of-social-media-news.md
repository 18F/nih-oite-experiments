<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

social media at this time, it is important to think about ways to manage
the stress of the news cycle. Explore healthy ways of finding
information, acknowledge the feelings often triggered by the news, and
manage the overwhelmed nature of unlimited, and often negative
news.</span>

Laurie Chaikind McNulty. The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
