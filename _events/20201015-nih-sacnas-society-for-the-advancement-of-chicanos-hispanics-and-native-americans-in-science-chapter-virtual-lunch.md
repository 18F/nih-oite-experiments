The NIH-SACNAS Chapter (Society for the Advancement of
Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science) would like to invite
you to their weekly virtual lunches on Thursdays.  

Join us this Thursday October 15th, 2020 at noon (EDT) to close out
Hispanic Heritage month by learning about and making "papel picado"
\[perforated paper\]. Come learn and talk about Hispanic/Latinx
scientists, learn about the history of papel picado and "dia de los
muertos" \[the day of the dead\], and make your own papel picado
\[perforated paper\]! Papel picado is a tradition in Mexico and other
Latin American countries, and it is a part of many holiday decorations.
Please have paper and a pair of scissors ready! We look forward to
seeing everyone there.

Everyone is welcome! 

This will be a virtual event. Registrants will receive meeting
information on the day of the event.

For any questions, please contact Dr. Rosario Jaime-Lara at
rosario.jaime-lara@nih.gov.
