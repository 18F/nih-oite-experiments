Ever wonder why you\'re feeling so tired at the end of the day when all
you\'ve been doing is sitting and talking with others on Zoom or some
other virtual platform?  Tired of seeing yourself up there with other
little faces in boxes? Tired of trying to maintain focus and attention
during Zoom meetings? Well, it turns out that this kind of interaction
is particularly taxing to both the mind and the body and there\'s a
reason why you\'ve been feeling so fatiqued!  Come to Wellness Wednesday
this week (ironically on Zoom) to talk about ways we can deal with
**\"Zoom Fatigue\"** and bring a little more energy and vitality into
our days!
