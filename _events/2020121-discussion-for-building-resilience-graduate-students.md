<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

rewarding endeavor of its own, but it often takes
place during periods of rapid growth both personally and
professionally. With so many things to juggle in graduate school it can
be easy to feel overwhelmed and sometimes disconnected if there are
unresolved interpersonal issues. Recent events have increased levels
of uncertainty with the added challenge of being physically distant
from mentors, mentees, lab mates, friends and family. Join us for a
chance to discuss the unique challenges you face as graduate
students and to learn how to manage them by talking to each
other. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

Scheiner. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.</span>
