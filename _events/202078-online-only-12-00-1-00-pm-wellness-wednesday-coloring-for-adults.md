Life is particularly hard right now. And sometimes the best thing you
can do is put down your pipette (if you\'re back in the lab), leave your
computer and your iPhone and . . . pick up a crayon! There are lots of
benefits to unplugging and taking a break to color as it is a great way
to unwind. Studies have shown that coloring can help reduce stress and
anxiety.  And the calming, therapeutic-like activity creates an outlet
for creativity, without requiring you to actually be artistic.  So bring
your adult coloring book or just free-style with some paper and crayons
or paint and join Dr. Ulli Klenke this *Wellness Wednesday* for
\"Coloring for Adults.\"
