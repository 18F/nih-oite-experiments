We spend more time talking to ourselves than we will ever spend talking
with others. Would you say to others, a good friend for example, the
types of things you say to yourself? Using the principles of
self-compassion, we'll examine how the messaging we give ourselves
impacts our feelings, mood, outlook and success. By holding more
compassion for ourselves, we make room to welcome greater understanding
that is rooted in kindness. Join our conversation as we explore
opportunities to understand what self-compassion is and how you can put
it to work for you! This session is open to trainees at all levels
(postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us or a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Lissa
Mantell in Building 2/Room 2W15.  The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for
the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you
come late or leave early, than not come at all.
