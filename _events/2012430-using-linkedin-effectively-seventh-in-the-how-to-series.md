In this \"How to\" workshop, we will examine how to use LinkedIn
effectively for your career.  We will explore creating your profile,
getting introduced to others, and finding connections.

This is the seventh in the new OITE \"How to\" series.  The
series dissects a variety of career paths and tools to explore what
skills are necessary to succeed and how you can get those skills
integrated into your resume as a grad student or postdoc.  Other parts
