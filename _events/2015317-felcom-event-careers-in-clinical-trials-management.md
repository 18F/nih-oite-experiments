new treatments be taken from the research level to large-scale
production for patient needs.  This is a multistep process, beginning
with identifying the underlying problem in a disease, developing a
treatment, moving it forward to large-scale testing in animal models,
performing clinical trials, and concluding in a standardized treatment
to the patient.  But many of us only see the research side of our work,
and are unaware of how scientists are also integral to conducting
clinical trials and ensuring new treatments meet FDA standards for
implementation.</span><span style="font-size: 11.5051517486572px;
line-height: 17.8329830169678px;"> A panel of speakers involved in
clinical trials management will discuss how they got into the clinical
side of drug development, their job responsibilities, and other aspects
of their careers.  Please join us to learn more!</span>
