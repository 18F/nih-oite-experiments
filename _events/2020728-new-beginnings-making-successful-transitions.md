Life is a series of choices and transitions. Transitions can be times of
personal growth and development. They can also be frustrating and
difficult. Much of the time, they are both. Worries about balancing
work, life, and family time; making school/career decisions; and
navigating interpersonal issues with mentors (and others) can contribute
to feelings of being overwhelmed and disconnected. A common element of
managing the challenges of life  is finding community, using resources,
and developing your problem solving, assertiveness, stress management,
and self-care skills. We will also briefly talk about unique challenges
and strategies about transferring from community college to 4-year
college and starting a graduate school or professional school program.
