<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Does balancing your work
responsibilities, personal life, and application process sometimes feel
like a juggling act?  Your family and friends may be supportive and
still not understand what you do at work, why you work so hard, and why
certain projects or deadlines are so important. Building your resiliency
and self-care skills will help you to successfully navigate through
these periods of transition and change, and will serve you well
throughout your academic and career path.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Jenn Wiggins. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills. </span>
