<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This event is only for NIH Intramural
Trainees currently in our postbac, graduate student, and postdoc
programs.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the link will
be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv announcements. If you need the
link immediately please email OITE@nih.gov. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Working from home is challenging. When we
throw in navigating distance learning with our kids, managing our own
emotions (and theirs), and tackling day-to-day household tasks, it seems
nearly impossible. Currently, any sort of work/life balance seems
unattainable, and many of us are struggling to remain productive while
managing current stressors. Join us as we process the challenges of our
current situation and examine ways to cope with the stress of working
from home with our children. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for an online discussion
with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. The resiliency group
provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and
proactive methods to build resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you
can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still
attend.  </span>
