In the holistic health model (body-mind-heart-spirit) we use in OITE's
wellness program, the fourth quadrant is spiritual wellbeing. 
Spirituality can be understood and experienced through both sectarian
(religious) and non-sectarian (secular) ways.  However an individual
understands and engages in spirituality, it can provide an important
dimension of wellness and self-care.  And this can be especially
important in difficult times, like the one we are currently
experiencing. This week\'s "Wellness Wednesday" will provide space for
talking about how each of us defines spirituality, as well as
identifying resources that nurture us spiritually.  Hope you can join us
to explore **Tapping into Resources for Spiritual Wellbeing**.
