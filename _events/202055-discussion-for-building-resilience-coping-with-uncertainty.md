<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Recent experiences of uncertainty,
disruption, and change have led to greatly increased stress and worry
for many of us.  Many of us are struggling with the uncertainty of what
the future will bring.  Our carefully planned projects and timelines are
being forced to change and we have no control over the outcome.  Loss of
our daily routines can further contribute to feeling unsettled and even
overwhelmed. This discussion will focus on finding ways to encourage and
support each other as we navigate through this uncertain time.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
