<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We all have
patterns of thinking that are distorted or inaccurate, which often
become our habitual way of interacting with the world. These false
beliefs are usually self-limiting and self-defeating and result in
considerable emotional turmoil and pain.  They may lead to overly
negative thoughts about a current or future situation and can lead us to
take actions that are against our best interests and derail our goals.
Let's talk about how to recognize these negative thoughts and make
positive changes. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Sabra Starnes. The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.</span>
