We experience grief when we lose something or someone we care about. 
During this time of a worldwide pandemic, we are all in the process of
grieving, which is a natural emotional response to loss or a significant
life change.  You may be grieving your sense of safety and routine, your
connection with colleagues at the lab, lost or delayed work
opportunities, holidays or other rituals, and connections with family
and friends.  Perhaps you are also grieving for a friend or family
member you have lost to the virus or another illness.  The process of
grieving is uniquely individual and may include feelings such as shock,
anger, sadness, depression, and even guilt.  Sometimes these feelings
conflict - - you may be sad and angry at the same time.   Each person
experiences grief in a unique way and on their own timeline.  Let\'s
talk about processing grief and moving forward. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Jonah Green.
The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
