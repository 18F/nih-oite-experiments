Times are particularly difficult right now.  On top of whatever personal
challenges or struggles we may be having, the COVID-19 health crisis and
the ongoing, heart-breaking news about racial injustice may make us feel
like everything is falling apart.  In these times, dark thoughts and
uncomfortable emotions often arise and we can get caught in a loop of
negative thinking and feeling - affecting every aspect of our lives. 
Come join us on Zoom to both share our experiences and talk about ways
to **Manage Difficult Thoughts &amp; Emotions**.

**The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you
