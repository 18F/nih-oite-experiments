Most scientists who write grants agree that the planning, writing, and
submission (and resubmission) process can be challenging. However, all
agree that the more you understand about the process, the easier it is.
Join us for this second session of a two-part introductory series on NIH
grants. This workshop focuses on project development and the writing of
effective training (for K Awards) and research plans. In addition, this
workshop will examine strategies for re-submission.
