**Back by popular demand!  **Mindfulness Painting is a creative practice
of using paint, paper and a brush to relieve your stress, bring your
focus to the present moment, and ignite your creativity. It\'s also a
great practice for releasing critical self-judgment and perfectionism.
This special offering to NIH trainees and fellows will take place on
**Monday**{::}**, December 9th**, from **3:00 - 5:00 p.m.** in the OITE
Conference Room (**Bldg. 2, Rm. 2W15**). No artistic ability needed, so
leave your inner art critic at home! **Space is limited so sign up
now!**

**Because space is limited, <span style="text-decoration:
underline;">PLEASE</span> be sure you will be able to attend so you
don\'t take space from someone else who would like to attend (thanks!).
 You **{::}**will be asked to confirm your attendance on the Friday
before the session!!**
