We all have patterns of thinking that are distorted or inaccurate, which
often become our habitual way of interacting with the world. These false
beliefs are usually self-limiting and self-defeating and result in
considerable emotional turmoil and pain.  They may lead to overly
negative thoughts about a current or future situation and can lead us to
take actions that are against our best interests and derail our goals.
Let's talk about how to recognize these negative thoughts and make
positive changes.   This session is open to trainees at all levels
(postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than not attend at all.
