This session will be held online via Zoom.  The meeting link will be
distributed on the NIH Trainee Listserv.  

Wellness is not merely the absence of illness or distress -- it involves
working toward positive, holistic health and wellbeing.  And in today's
world, this is a lifelong process of making decisions that support a
more balanced life and enable you to maximize your potential. The first
step is to get a realistic picture of how you're doing now.  Then based
on this picture, the next step is to create a workable self-care plan. 
This week we will talk about the meaning of *Holistic Health*, take
a *Self-Care Assessment*{::}*, *and begin the process of mapping out
a *Self-Care Plan*{::}*.  *Come to this informal discussion group to get
started on supporting a healthier you!  (If you've already completed the
OITE Self-Care Assessment and Plan, it might be a good time to revisit
it.  See where you've improved and what areas need a bit more
attention!) 

Please join us online for for this wellness session with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Kelly Donahue. The session provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.
