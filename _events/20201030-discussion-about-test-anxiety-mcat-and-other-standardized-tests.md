<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: helvetica;">So many of our
postbacs are currently worried about MCATs, GREs, and other standardized
tests that are gateways to the next step. For some of us, no matter what
strategies we try we are left feeling that we are not good enough. For
others, we know we would benefit from accommodations but stress around
the request process hold us back. And it is hard not to feel that our
score defines us as a person, even though we know we are so much more
than our performance on this one test.  Let\'s talk about wellness
strategies to maintain a healthy balance as you tackle these
challenges.   </span>

<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Please join
us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin Futrovsky
Gates and Pre-med advisor Dr. Kristen Zukosky.  The group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive
methods to build resilience and self-care skills, and perform at your
full potential. </span>

be held online via Zoom and the link will be sent a few minutes before
the session. </span>
