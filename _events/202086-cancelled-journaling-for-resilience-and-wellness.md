This event has been cancelled. 

Journaling is a great way to connect with yourself, work through
challenges, express inner thoughts and emotions, and support your
goals.  Research shows that it has both physical and mental health
benefits, including better immune functioning, decrease in blood
pressure, better sleep, decrease in depression and anxiety, and improved
working memory.  Join us and experience how journaling can be helpful to
you. **Please have a journal/paper and pen for the session.  **

Please join us to learn about journaling for wellness with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Kelly Donahue.  The session provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.
