Career planning and job searches take an enormous amount of time and
energy, with many ups and downs throughout. While we frequently talk
about the nuts and bolts of the career exploration and the job search
process, we don\'t usually talk about how stressful and emotionally
challenging the process can be. A common element of navigating the
challenges of job searching is using resources, and developing your
stress management, and self-care skills.  Whether you are at the
beginning of your job search or in the final negotiations, it is always
a good time to build resiliency and self-care skills that will help you
successfully navigate through periods of transition and change.

The resiliency group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore the ups and downs of the job search process in a positive and
proactive way to build resilience. We will not discuss resumes/CVs,
interviewing techniques, or the other mechanics of finding a job. Please
join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner. Even if you can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage
you to still attend.  We would rather you arrive late or leave early,
than not attend at all.
