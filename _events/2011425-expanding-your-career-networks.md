This session will dissect both online and in-person networking, an
important component of successful career building at all career
stages. Not only is it important to develop a network, but it also takes
time to manage your network. We will dive deeper into managing networks,
covering topics that include identifying career advocates, interacting
with colleagues, and building meaningful long-term communication with
individuals who may enhance your career.

This session will be videocast at videocast.nih.gov
