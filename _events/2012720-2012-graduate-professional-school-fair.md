The <strong>NIH Graduate and Professional School Fair, </strong>to be
held on July 20, 2012 from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm on the Bethesda campus of
the NIH, will provide an opportunity for NIH summer interns (especially
those in college) and NIH postbacs, as well as other college students in
the DC area, to prepare for the next step in their careers by exploring
educational programs leading to the PhD, MD, DDS, MD/PhD, and other
graduate and professional degrees. More than 100 outstanding colleges
and universities from across the U.S. will be sending representatives of
their graduate schools, medical and dental schools, schools of public
health, and other biomedically relevant programs to the Fair in the
hopes of recruiting NIH trainees.

The day will also include workshops on getting to graduate and
professional school, MD/PhD programs, interviewing, and careers in
public health, psychology, and dentistry. Exhibits will be open from
10:00 am to1:45 pm.
