<span style="font-size: 10pt;">So many of our postbacs are currently
worried about MCATS, GREs, and other standardized tests, coupled with
applications and interviews.  The pandemic has brought many changes to
the current testing and application season.  Not only are these changes
beyond our control, but the uncertainty of how they will impact our
carefully made plans for applying to grad or professional school and
ultimately reaching our career goals can be stressful. Let\'s connect
with each other and build your resilience and self-care skills so you
can cope effectively during this stressful time and work toward
achieving your academic and career goals.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates The discussion group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
