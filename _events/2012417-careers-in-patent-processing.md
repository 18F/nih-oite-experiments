Are you interested in using your technical understanding to communicate
and protect the intellectual property of others? Join us to discover
what it takes to enter the exciting and rewarding field of patent
processing. This panel will include specialists working both privately
and within the government and will highlight careers such as a patent
agent, patent examiner, and technology transfer specialist. You will
learn what steps each speaker took to enter this field, how a scientific
background helped their career at various stages, and what additional
training is necessary to join the field of patent processing. After
brief introductions, the floor will be open for a question and answer
session with the panelists. This event is sponsored by FELCOM\'s Career
Development Subcommittee.

This seminar will be videocast at videocast.nih.gov
