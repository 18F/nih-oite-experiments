Finding a local community and developing new connections, while learning
how to navigate NIH can be difficult and lonely.  We invite you to join
us to open a conversation around building your support system as a
trainee at the NIH.  This session is open to trainees at all levels
(postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us on for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than to not attend at all.
