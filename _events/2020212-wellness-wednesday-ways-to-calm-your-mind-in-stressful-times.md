There is no such thing as a "stress-free" life (or day or sometimes even
hour...). I And when we're studying for the MCAT/GRE or applying to
medical/graduate school or engaged in a job search *on top* of our usual
tasks, life can begin to feel really out of control. In response to
these demands, we often just overschedule ourselves, push harder, drink
more coffee, and hope things will get better -- but most often, there
are just new demands waiting for us around the corner.  So come to
*Wellness Wednesday* this week and learn some ways to **Calm Your Mind**
(and thus, your body) when life is overwhelming.  **Feel free to bring
your lunch -- microwave is available!**
