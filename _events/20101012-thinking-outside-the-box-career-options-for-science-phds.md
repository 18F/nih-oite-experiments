Are you looking for new ideas about ways you can use the PhD you worked
so hard to get? You\'ve heard about careers in technology transfer,
science policy, consulting, and academia, but have you ever wondered
what else is out there? This panel will explore careers you might never
have considered including careers in the food industry, sales, defense
contracting, zoological parks, and museum conservation. Attendees will
have the opportunity to learn how research skills can be put to use in
different professional settings. This event is sponsored by FELCOM\'s
Career Development Subcommittee.
