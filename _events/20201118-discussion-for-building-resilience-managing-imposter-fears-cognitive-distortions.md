We all have patterns of thinking that are distorted or inaccurate, which
often become our habitual way of interacting with the world. These false
beliefs are usually self-limiting and self-defeating and result in
considerable emotional turmoil and pain. At times, our inner voice
causes many of us to feel less confident and knowledgeable than we
really are - - so we feel like an imposter. Let's talk about how to
recognize these negative thoughts and make positive changes.  This
session will help you to explore strategies for facing and minimizing
negative thoughts, identifying positive qualities, and communicating in
a more assertive and confident manner.  

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Liann
Seiter. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space
to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
