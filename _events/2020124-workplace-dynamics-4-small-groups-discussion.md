Take a deeper dive into the material from Workplace Dynamics 4: Building
teams. In small groups we will discuss team dynamics, make a plan for
how you can lead without power, and improve workplace relationships.

For this session, please attend the workshop on Nov 20. Additionally,
any previous attendees of Workplace Dynamic 4: Team Dynamcis are also
welcome to these small group discussions.

Register here, and we will share the zoom link the day of the event.
