We all experience setback and disappointments in science, work and life.
In this webinar we will look at seven key elements of resilience with a
focus on building habits that promote healthier responses and resilient
behaviors in the face of set-back in educational and work environments.

## Becoming a Resilient Scientist Series

Navigating school, the career exploration process, research
environments, and the stress of national/international news can seem
overwhelming and lead us to doubt ourselves just when we need confidence
the most. Through workshops and group discussions in this series
(discussion groups will be held in the week following the lecture, more
info will be provided via email), we will work to identify attitudes and
behaviors that can help us be more resilient as we navigate difficult
situations in school, work and life. Each workshop will highlight
emotional intelligence competencies needed for success in research and
healthcare careers and will provide strategies for developing these
competencies as part of your educational journey. While you may
participate in any of the webinars, it is best to participate in the
entire series as the material relates and concepts will be developed
throughout the series. The workshops and group discussions in the series
are:

Session 1 -- Sept: I. An Introduction to Resilience and Wellness 

Session 2 -- Oct: II. Exploring our Self-Talk: Cognitive Distortions and
Imposter Fears

Session 3 -- Nov: III. Emotions and Emotional Intelligence in the
Workplace

Session 4 -- Dec: IV. Self-Advocacy and Assertiveness for Scientists

Session 5 -- Jan: V. Developing Feedback Resilience

Session 6 -- Feb: VI. Managing Up to Maximize Mentoring Relationships
