<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As we heard at the recent NIH Town Hall,
NIH IC have been making plans for personnel to return to the labs and
offices. As these plans unfold, there is still much uncertainty about
how this will be safely accomplished. You may have concerns about
exposure to COVID-19, worries about how will you safely navigate public
transportation, or uncertainty about childcare and other family
responsibilities as you return to the workplace.  You may also be
anxious about when and how the lab will manage work reentry, the safety
procedures that will be put in place, and how these requirements will
impact your ability to work. Thinking about everything can be
overwhelming. </span>

Wellness Advisor, Liann Seiter.   The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to plan for re-entry to work. </span>
