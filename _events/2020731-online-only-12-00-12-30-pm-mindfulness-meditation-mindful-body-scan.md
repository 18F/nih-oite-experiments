Practicing a **Mindful Body Scan **is simply connecting with our
physical selves and noticing how the body is doing in the present
moment.  We are not trying to change anything - we\'re just being with
\"what is\"  (Oh, there\'s some tension here, warmth here, not much of
anything here.) Holding sensations in our awareness without judging them
or reacting to them allows us to be with "what is" -- letting them be as
they are without triggering so much emotional reactivity or agitated
thinking about them.  Thus, the body scan is another way to practice
"noticing" and "welcoming" -- skills that we can bring into the rest of
lives as well.  Hope you can join us!
