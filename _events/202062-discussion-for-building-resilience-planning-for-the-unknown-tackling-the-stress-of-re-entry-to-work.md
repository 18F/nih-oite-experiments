<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As we heard at the NIH Town Hall last
week, NIH ICs are starting to make plans for personnel to return to the
labs and offices. As we wait to hear how these plans will unfold, there
is still much uncertainty about how this will be safely accomplished.
You may have concerns about exposure to COVID-19, worries about how will
you safely navigate public transportation, or uncertainty about
childcare and other family responsibilities as you return to the
workplace.  You may also be anxious about when and how the lab will
manage work reentry, the safety procedures that will be put in place,
and how these requirements will impact your ability to work. Thinking
about everything can be overwhelming. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner.   The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to plan for re-entry to work. </span>
