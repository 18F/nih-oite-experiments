Research Ethics is at the foundation of everything we do in the
scientific endeavor, and training in Responsible Conduct of Research is
an essential component of your development as a scientist as you train
here at the NIH. OITE is offering this course specifically for Postdocs
to ensure that you have the foundation to both conduct rigorous and
ethical research and to train others to do the same.

This course will help fulfill Ethics Training requirements for those of
you applying for K awards or other fellowships and ensure that you are
receiving guidance in line with what is expected in the extramural
world. The course will also cover training responsible research to
mentees as you move into roles of increased mentorship.

This course, \"Becoming a Responsible Scientist\" is offered as a
full-day workshop (10:00am - 4:30pm), using a combination of lecture,
video, writing exercises, small group discussions, and full class
discussions. Certificates will be issued to those who successfully
complete the entire course.
