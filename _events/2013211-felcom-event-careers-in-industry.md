 Tired of staring at the calendar and wondering if your post-doc will
ever end? Does the \'next-step\' terrify you more than cell culture
contamination? If either of these rings true, then this panel is
definitely for you! The FELCOM-Career Development team is bringing you a
stellar panel of industry scientists to talk about their likes,
dislikes, and how to make it in the world of biotechnology and other
non-academic science positions.  In addition, a social networking event
will follow immediately after the panel, and it will include many more
industry professionals that will not be in attendance for the panel
discussion.  Come and join the conversation for our \'***Careers in
Industry***\' panel to see if this is the right career choice for you!
