Let\'s explore themes of self-awareness and self-management. We will
discuss your preferences, work, and communication styles that influence
interactions you encounter in any research group or workgroup.   

This workshop combines the first two session in our Workplace Dynamics
Series.  Fellows who attend all sessions will earn a certificate. 
Please note that this session has been offered in the past, and earlier
attendance will count towards your certificate.
