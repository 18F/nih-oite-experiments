<span style="font-size: 12px;">Have you ever wondered what happens once
a grant is awarded?  Do you enjoy working with budgets, policies and
guidelines?  Are you organized and able to keep multiple projects afloat
simultaneously?  Then you should come to the next Felcom Career
Development event: Careers in Grants Management!  We have gathered
together panelists from within the NIH, from other governmental
agencies, and from the private sector to share how they transitioned
from the lab to their current positions and what their day-to-day
responsibilities include.  Come join in the discussion and see if a
career in Grants Management is right for you!   </span>
