If you are a graduate student who is beginning to ask questions such as
\"Do I need to do a postdoc?\" \"What kind of postdoc should I do?\" or
\"What can I expect in a postdoc?\" or a Postdoc thinking about doing a
second postdoc then this workshop is for you. The discussion in this
workshop explored the issues that graduate students need to consider if
they plan to pursue a postdoctoral position. This workshop would be most
beneficial to graduate students who are in their 3rd year or above or
any postdoc thinking of an additional postdoc.
