<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

test, act quickly in an emergency and feeling depressed can
help us preserve energy, but in excess they can seriously impact our
ability to function and take on new challenges. Mental health conditions
like anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD/ADD, ASD sometimes occur as these
natural systems become dysregulated. While experiencing the effects of
anxiety and depression may be overwhelming, there are ways to manage and
work with these feelings. Come share your thoughts and learn from each
other's experiences in dealing with anxiety and depression. </span>

space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.</span>
