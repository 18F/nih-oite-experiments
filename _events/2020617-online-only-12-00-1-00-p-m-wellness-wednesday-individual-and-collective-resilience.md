Resilience is generally understood as having the capacity to \"bounce
back\" from difficult experiences. as well as learning how to thrive and
grow beyond such experiences.  Increasingly, resilience is seen as not
only relevant to individuals, but also pertinent for collectives, such
as small groups, organizations, or even whole societies.  We at the NIH
are currently experiencing the twin adversities of the COVID-19 health
crisis and the ongoing negative effects of racism and social injustice.
This week\'s Wellness Wednesday will be an opportunity to discuss the
linkages between **Individual and Collective Resilience** and share how
we might support both within the NIH community.

**The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you
need the link immediately please email maria.gutierrez2@nih.gov**
