<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This session will be held online via
Zoom.  A link will be distributed to registrants.  Registration is
limited to 20 participants.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Current events may have left you feeling
physically, emotionally, or spiritually isolated from your families,
friends, and communities as you prepare for the spring holidays.  Maybe
your plans to celebrate with loved ones have been cancelled, you are
currently residing far away from those you care about, or your places of
worship have been closed.  It is quite common to experience changes in
mood and feelings of loss when you are removed from your community and
traditions during holidays. You may be finding it hard to rectify
feelings of sadness and the desire for joy during this time of
celebration.  Join us as we discuss the challenges of experiencing
holidays alone and explore how we can take care of ourselves and each
other during this time. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Erin Futrovsky. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
