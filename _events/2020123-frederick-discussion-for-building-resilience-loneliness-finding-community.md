Finding a local community and developing new connections, while learning
how to navigate Frederick can be difficult and lonely.  We invite you to
join us to open a conversation around building your support system as a
trainee at the NIH.  This session is open to trainees at all levels
(postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Kelly
Donahue at NCI Frederick in Building 549/Conference Room B.  The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care skills.
Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to
still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave early, than to not
attend at all.
