<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The past few months have seen significant
change and challenge in our lives and we are likely to continue to
experience change and uncertainty as opportunities to further engage in
our communities increase. Not being able to plan for or anticipate
future disruption or challenge can feel stressful. This discussion will
explore the realities of current uncertainties we face and encourage
discussion about ways to deal with the things we cannot control.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Denise Saunders. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
