Prepare in advance for your graduate school interviews!  This workshop
will discuss the interview process from the perspective of both those
doing the interviewing and the applicant.  The discussion will cover
what to expect, how to prepare, what kinds of questions you might be
asked, and appropriate interview behavior.  Postbacs who attend will be
given priority to meet in small groups for mock interviews.
