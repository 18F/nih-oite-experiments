Being a scientist requires a tremendous amount of resilience --
experiments fail, papers get rejected, we struggle to communicate
effectively with our supervisors and peers, and establishing healthy
work-life boundaries can be a challenge, even in good times. These
challenges are amplified greatly during this current crisis where we are
bombarded by stressful news and have to make major adjustments to the
ways we can and cannot do work. Join Dr. Sharon Milgram, Director NIH
OITE, for a workshop focused broadly on resilience in research
environments with a special focus on topics that are an especially
challenging now. Topics to be addressed include, setting expectations
and responding to the expectations of others, staying focused when
teleworking, dealing with career-related anxieties, and strategies for
building our resilience for now and in the long-term.
