It can be hard to begin (or begin again) a personal exercise program at
any time, but in the time of COVID-19, this can be especially
challenging!  Whether it's running, weight training, yoga or some other
form of exercise, the research is clear that regular exercise is
essential for our physical and mental wellbeing.  So how do we bring
this important self-care ingredient into our lives during this difficult
time?  On this week's *Wellness Wednesday*, come join Dr. Darryl Murray
to talk about how to identify the exercise program that's best for you
at this time and find ways to maintain it now and in the future!
