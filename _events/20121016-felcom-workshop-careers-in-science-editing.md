Have you always enjoyed communicating science? Have you ever wondered
about a career in scientific writing and editing that goes beyond
publishing academic papers? If so, then this seminar is for you. The
seminar will explore the diverse opportunities in the area of science
editing. The panel includes Ph.D. level scientists who have successfully
transitioned into careers in science editing at journals, non-profit
organizations, and here at NIH. Fellows will learn how to successfully
transition from the bench into the field, what types of jobs are
available, and what entry-level requirements are necessary. After short
introductions and presentations, the floor will be open for a question
and answer session with the panelists. This event is sponsored by
[FELCOM\'s](/felcom) Career Development Subcommittee.
