This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

This week we will focus on how to deal with difficult situations and
transitions.  Are you not sure how to open a productive dialog with your
PI or mentor about career transitions, projects, papers, and personal
needs?  Are you transitioning into a new career path or considering a
lab change don't know how to tell your research mentors? No matter what
the situation, we want to help you turn a potentially
stressful situation into a positive interaction.  You aren\'t alone. 
Let's talk about it. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive methods to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can't join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.
