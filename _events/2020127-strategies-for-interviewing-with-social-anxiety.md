<span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 10pt;">Interviewing for
schools and jobs is stressful under the best of circumstances, and it
can be extremely so for those of us with social anxiety.  Please join us
to learn about common anxiety triggers, the use of healthy coping to
build resilience against stress, and tools to combat unhelpful coping,
such as avoidance and procrastination.  The program will have a specific
focus on managing social anxiety, which can often present throughout the
interview process as you interact with a multitude of new
people.  </span>
