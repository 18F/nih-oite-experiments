Diversity.... difference.... post-racial..... multicultural -  all
buzzwords we regularly hear.  But how often do we as future scientists,
healthcare providers, science educators, and policy experts stop to
consider our own reactions to diversity and difference?  Furthermore,
why does this matter to our research and how do we build inclusive and
welcoming work environments? This workshop will examine the meaning of
diversity in the lives of individuals, groups, and communities, as well
as the larger society and scientific community.
