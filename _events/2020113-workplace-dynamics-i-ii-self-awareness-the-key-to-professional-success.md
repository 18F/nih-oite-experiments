<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17.8329830169678px;">*We have
combined the content from WPD1 and WPD2 into one workshop, you get full
credit for both workshops*</span>

We each bring our unique personalities and work styles to our research
group, classroom, workplace, and home. Understanding your style and
appreciating that others have different styles can enhance your
interactions and help you succeed. This workshop will explore
differences in personalities and work styles that impact the way we
communicate, take in information, make decisions, engage in conflict,
learn, and plan our day. The workshop will include group activities and
hands-on experiences related to working successfully in research team
environments.

Pre-work: All participants should complete an online MBTI Assessment
through the OITE.  The OITE staff will provide you with a link to
complete the MBTI approximately two weeks before the workshop.

This workshop is the combines the first two sessions of the
multi-workshop Workplace Dynamics series.  Fellows who attend all
sessions will earn a certificate.  Please note that this session has
been offered in the past, and earlier attendance will count towards your
certificate.
