Rooted in the Thomas and Kilmann Conflict Grid, this interactive
workshop provides an accessible framework for conflict management and
giving and receiving personal feedback. In small group exercises,
participants learn how to have - and even get some practice having
- difficult conversations often associated with conflict within the NIH,
like leadership struggles and authorship questions.  Note, this is the
third session in the series, fellows who attend all sessions will
receive a certificate and qualify for management bootcamp.
