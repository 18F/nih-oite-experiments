Transitional awards are available for NIH trainees intending to enter
academia. This session will discuss the K99 and K22 application process.
We will discuss the stages of the application process and will cover
topics including assessing whether the K99 or K22 is right for you,
intramural policies for applying, developing training and research
plans, and optimizing your interactions with program directors and
review officers. *This session will be videocast in real time and also
archived at videocast.nih.gov. Please register with the OITE even if you
plan on watching by video, especially if you would like a copy of the
slides.*
