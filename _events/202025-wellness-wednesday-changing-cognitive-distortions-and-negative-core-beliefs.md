We all have patterns of thinking that are distorted or inaccurate, which
often become our habitual way of interacting with the world. These false
beliefs are usually self-limiting and self-defeating and result in
considerable emotional turmoil and pain.  They can also lead us to
taking actions that are against our best interests.  Come to *Wellness
Wednesday* this week and learn how these ingrained cognitive patterns,
which are often out beyond our conscious awareness, can be identified
and modified for the better!  **Feel free to bring your lunch --
