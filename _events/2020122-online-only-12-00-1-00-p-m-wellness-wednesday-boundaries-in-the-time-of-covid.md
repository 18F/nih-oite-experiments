*As the holiday season is upon us, we are faced with making many
challenging decisions regarding travel and being with family and
friends. Given the pandemic, we want ourselves and those that we care
about to be safe, which is adding an additional layer of complexity to
the holiday season. In effort to prioritize health and wellness, coming
to the decision of not traveling comes with conflicting feelings and
setting this boundary may feel uncomfortable. Join us this Wellness
Wednesday to explore coping with safety decisions, saying no,
negotiating boundaries, and the loneliness that may arise due to the
precautions you have chosen.*
