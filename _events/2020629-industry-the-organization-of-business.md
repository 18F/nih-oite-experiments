Are you thinking about a career in industry but do not know how
businesses operate? This workshop examines the critical functions common
to all companies and how those companies are organized to optimize the
performance of these functions. We will cover the various positions and
roles, specifically within R&amp;D organizations, to illustrate where
the job titles that you see in job advertisements fit into the overall
organizations of the companies. In addition, you will be introduced to
common terminology used within each of the organizational functions
(such as defining a matrix team). This workshop will help you be more
prepared and savvy during your interviews for industry positions by
having a better comprehension of the terms and organizational structures
used in business environments.
