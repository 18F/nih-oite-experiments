Most scientists who write grants agree that the planning, writing, and
submission (and resubmission) process can be challenging. However, all
agree that the more you understand about the process, the easier it is.
Join us for this first session of a two-part introductory series on NIH
grants. This workshop focuses on finding funding opportunities at the
NIH and beyond and elucidating aspects of the NIH grant review process,
such as understanding the NIH peer review system; demystifying study
sections; and the new NIH submission guidelines and review criteria.
