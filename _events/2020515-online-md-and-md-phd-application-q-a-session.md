During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the pre-medical team will answer
questions about the medical school application, AMCAS and MCAT updates,
and other general questions. We are going to be meeting every week.
Personal Statements will be discussed in separate sessions (see OITE
upcoming events). These sessions are not consecutive, so you can attend
one or more, and as many as you want. 

If you are interested, please register at least one hour before the
event, as we will be sending the zoom link to all people registered by
1:00 pm on the day of the session.
