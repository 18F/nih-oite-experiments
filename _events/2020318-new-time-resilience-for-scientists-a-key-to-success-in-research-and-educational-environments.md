<span style="font-size: 11.5052px;">Navigating new research groups, the
career exploration process, applications, and more can seem overwhelming
and lead us to doubt ourselves just when we need confidence the most. In
this interactive workshop, we will discuss attitudes and behaviors that
can get in our way and explore strategies for building resilience and
dealing with self-doubt and developing our confidence. The workshop will
highlight the emotional intelligence competencies needed for success in
research and healthcare careers and will provide insights into
approaches for developing these competencies as part of the </span>NIH
