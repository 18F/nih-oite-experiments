The Mom-Dad-Docs team would like to invite you to our bi-weekly virtual
lunch on Tuesdays. 

Today, our topic will be \"Gratitude\". Let\'s talk about how you teach
your kids gratitude especially in times like these. With lunches like
this we stay connected with other parent trainees. Join us for a virtual
lunch by sharing a meal, chat, and de-stress while you telework.

Everyone is welcome! 

Please register for this event to receive the login in information for
the meetings, which will be held every other Tuesday.

*What is Mom-Dad-Docs?* The mission of this group is to provide a
supportive community for postdoc, clinical fellow and graduate student
parents at the NIH. This group will discuss and address issues and
challenges of juggling parenthood and a scientific career at the same
time. Monthly meetings will alternate between in-person discussions and
webinars to provide postdoc/clinical fellow/graduate student parents a
chance to meet while learning more about topics such as time management,
career, and general parenting questions. Guest speakers will present
topics, insights and resources. The Mom-Dad-Docs group welcomes all male
and female post-docs, clinical fellows, trainees, graduate students and
mentors with children (or thinking about having children).
