<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Holding productive conversations with
 PIs (and other important mentors) about careers, projects, papers, and
personal needs can be challenging.  Do you need to open a difficult
dialog with your PI or other mentor, but not sure where to start?  It
could be that you've decided to change your career path and don't know
how to tell your research mentors,  or that you want to negotiate about
leave time, the order of authors on a paper, or setting a defense date. 
Whatever the situation, we want to help you turn a potentially stressful
conversation into a positive interaction. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Wayne Marshall.  The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for
the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you
come late or leave early, than not come at all.   </span>
