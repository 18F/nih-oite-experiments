Unlike undergraduate education, graduate school is often unstructured.
You will be deciding how to spend your time, what lines of investigation
to follow, and what skills you need to develop. You may have to create
opportunities for yourself. This workshop will discuss strategies for
thriving and achieving your goals in graduate school.
