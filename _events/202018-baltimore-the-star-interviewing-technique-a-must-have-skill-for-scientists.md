**This session on the Baltimore, MD campus**

Learn and practice the STAR behavioral interviewing technique. This will
help you answer tough questions on interviews like, \"Tell me about a
time you struggled in lab,\" or Tell me about your best example of
leadership\". These questions will be asked during industry, academic
jobs, and interviews and interviews for graduate and professional
school.

Designed as a quick lunch talk, these short sessions will give you the
basics to build your career. Feel free to bring your own lunch (no food
provided)
