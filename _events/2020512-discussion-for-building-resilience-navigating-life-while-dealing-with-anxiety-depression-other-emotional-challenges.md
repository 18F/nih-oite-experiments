<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The past few
weeks have been very difficult for everyone.  Even in the best of times,
juggling all of our work, career and life responsibilities is
challenging even when things are mostly going well. Now there are new
challenges every day.  When we hit a bump, in one area or another, we
may lose focus and our sense of calm. Navigating challenges can be even
more difficult in the context of excessive anxiety, depression, OCD,
ADHD/ADD, ASD or other mental health conditions. On top of the challenge
itself, it can be difficult dealing with stigma and finding safe places
to talk things through. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.</span>
