This session will touch on career planning topics specific to
international trainees. We will talk about how to get the most out of
your time at the NIH, how to plan your time to transition to a position
after your NIH time is up, and common concerns that we hear in the OITE
from our international fellows. We will cover topics for visiting
fellows wanting to stay in the US as well as looking for a job outside
of the US (i.e. returning to your home country or another country).
