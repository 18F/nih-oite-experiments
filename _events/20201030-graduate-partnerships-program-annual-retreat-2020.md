Join us for the first ever virtual GPP retreat! This three hour event is
packed with ways to learn about stress management during a particularly
stressful year and with chances to unwind with your fellow graduate
students! Dr. Sharon Milgram, Director of the NIH Office of Intramural
Training and Education, will discuss her own graduate experience and
career trajectory, as well as what drew her to providing wellness
education for trainees. Experience the \'Best of OITE Wellness\' with
popcorn-style discussion groups, and participate in fun team-building
activities with your peers. Fun is a big part of wellness! Laughter is,
too, so we\'ll close out the event with a set from Kasha Patel, a
science writer for NASA by day and a stand-up comedian at venues like
the Drafthouse Comedy Theater by night. 

Highlights of the day include:

* Insights into Dr. Sharon Milgram\'s career journey
* A chance to chat with OITE Wellness Advisors
* An opportunity to get to know other graduate students
