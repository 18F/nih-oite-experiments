Leaving their children in somebody else\'s care is the hardest thing to
do for parents. We need to know they are safe, in a loving and caring
environment. Stimulation and education are as important to us. So how do
we find that one daycare that will fit all our demands? Linda Owen has
spent over 20 years in different positions in the Montgomery County
Child Care system and will talk to us about how to choose a daycare.
What questions to ask, what points to discuss and what red flags to look
for during a visit.

What is Mom-Dad-Docs? The mission of this group is to provide a
supportive community for postdoc, clinical fellow and graduate student
parents at the NIH. This group will discuss and address issues and
challenges of juggling parenthood and a scientific career at the same
time. Monthly meetings will alternate between in-person discussions and
webinars to provide postdoc/clinical fellow/graduate student parents a
chance to meet while learning more about topics such as time management,
career, and general parenting questions. Guest speakers will present
topics, insights and resources. The Mom-Dad-Docs group welcomes all male
and female post-docs, clinical fellows, trainees, graduate students and
mentors with children (or thinking about having children).Â 

\* BYOL- Lunch will not be provided, but we welcome attendees to bring
lunch with them to the event.
