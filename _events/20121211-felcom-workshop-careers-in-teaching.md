 Have you always enjoyed mentoring young enthusiastic students? Would
you like to embark on a career shaping the future of young scientific
minds? If so, this seminar on \"Careers in Teaching\" is for you! This
seminar will highlight teaching options available in diverse educational
environments ranging from prestigious academic research institutions to
local high schools and provide information for scientists interested in
teaching. The panelists will share information about what their
responsibilities are, what types of positions exist, and how you can
prepare for achieving similar positions. After short introductions and
presentations, the floor will be open for a question and answer session
with the panelists. This event is sponsored by FELCOM\'s Career
Development Subcommittee.

*This event will not be videocast, but a write-up of the information
presented in the seminar will be available on the OITE website
approximately one month after the event.*
