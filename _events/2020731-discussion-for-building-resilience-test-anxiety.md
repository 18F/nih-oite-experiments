<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

postbac, graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be
held online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee
Listserv announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

and other standardized tests that are gateways to the next step. For
some of us, no matter what strategies we try we are left feeling that we
are not good enough. For others, we know we would benefit from
accommodations but stress around the request process hold us back. And
it is hard not to feel that our score defines us as a person, even
though we know we are so much more than our performance on this one
test.  Let\'s talk about wellness strategies to maintain a healthy
balance as you tackle these challenges.   </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:
10pt;">Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Erin Gates. The resiliency group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive methods to build
resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you can't join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
