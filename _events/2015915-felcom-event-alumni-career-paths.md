<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17.8329830169678px;">The
Fellows Committee, or FelCom, has been around for 20 years!  Its members
consist of two representatives from each Institute and Chairpersons from
each of eight subcommittees, as well as liaisons to various on- and
off-campus groups.  The Career Development Committee reached out to past
FelCom members to see what they\'re up to now.  Join us to hear how
their careers have progressed and how serving on FelCom and other
committees helped them get where they are today!</span>
