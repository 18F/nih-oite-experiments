Journaling is a great way to connect with yourself, work through
challenges, express inner thoughts and emotions, and support your
goals.  Research shows that it has both physical and mental health
benefits, including better immune functioning, decrease in blood
pressure, better sleep, decrease in depression and anxiety, and improved
working memory.  Come experience how journaling can be helpful to
you. **Please bring a journal/paper and pen.  **

Please join us to learn about journaling for wellness with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Kelly Donahue at NCI Frederick in Building 549/Conference Room
B.  The session provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care skills.
