This session is only for NIH Intramural Trainees.  This online session
will be held with Zoom.  The meeting link will be distributed via the
NIH Trainee Listservs. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov.

We spend more time talking to ourselves than we will ever spend talking
with others. Would you say to others, a good friend for example, the
types of things you say to yourself? Using the principles of
self-compassion, we'll examine how the messaging we give ourselves
impacts our feelings, mood, outlook and success. By holding more
compassion for ourselves, we make room to welcome greater understanding
that is rooted in kindness. Join our conversation as we explore
opportunities to understand what self-compassion is and how you can put
it to work for you! 

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Kelly Donahue  The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.
