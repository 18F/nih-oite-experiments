We are in our sixth month of dealing with COVID-19 and everyone is
feeling tired of it. This tiredness is being called **\"COVID-19 or
Coronavirus Fatigue\"** and it\'s taking a toll on our physical, mental,
emotional, and spiritual health.   There are many layers to this
particular tiredness: fatigue from living in isolation without much
human contact; fatigue from having to figure out how to work and parent
in a new way; fatigue from the daily reporting of bad news; and even
\"caution fatigue,\" which is causing people to backslide in terms of
taking necessary precautions to avoid spreading the virus.  If you
relate to any of this, come to Wellness Wednesday this week to talk
about what you\'re experiencing and what strategies we can all use to
remain motivated, shore up our resilience, boost our optimism, and
survive (and maybe even thrive) during this difficult time. 

The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you need
