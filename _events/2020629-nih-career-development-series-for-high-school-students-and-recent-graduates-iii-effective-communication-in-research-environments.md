Good communication is a key success factor in science and all careers.
The workshop will cover both written (such as effective email) and
verbal (networking and elevator talks) forms of communication.
Communication also includes listening skills, such as receiving feedback
without feeling criticized. Join us to learn both valuable skills to
enhance your professional image and strategies for meeting NIH
expectations for professional behavior.

Note: Students who attend at least five workshops will be eligible to
receive a certificate of completion.
