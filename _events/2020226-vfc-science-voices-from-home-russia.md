*Dr. Alexey K. Shaytan received a PhD in polymer physics from Moscow
State University (Russia) and the University of Ulm (Germany). He then
became a research fellow at the Faculty of Biology of Moscow State
University where he was conducting computational and biophysical studies
of chromatin. After a 4-year period as a postdoctoral visiting fellow at
NIH (NCBI), Dr. Shaytan became the leader of the Integrative Biology
Group at the Department of Bioengineering ( Faculty of Biology of Moscow
State University). His research interest focuses on studying chromatin
structure using a combination of biophysical, modeling and
bioinformatics techniques.
