<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

research.  We also realize that our international fellows face a unique
set of issues and stresses. Searching for a job can be extremely
stressful in the best of circumstances.  Watching world events unfold
and facing the uncertainty of what the future will hold can be
scary. Particularly now, being far from family and home, lacking a local
community, and learning a new culture can be difficult and lonely. You
are not alone in dealing with these issues, other NIH international
fellows are having the same experiences. </span>

Emilie Gomart. The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
