Zoom.  The link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is currently a lot happening both
here and in the world.  The constant barrage of information from social
media and news can be overwhelming.  Add to that the frustration of not
feeling in control and the anxiety about what the future may bring can
be very stressful, particularly when friends and family live far
away.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Laurie Chaikind McNulty. The discussion group provides
a welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive
ways to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
