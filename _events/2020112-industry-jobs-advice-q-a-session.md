During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the career counseling team will
answer questions about industry careers

This is not a workshop, but a chance for you to drop-in and get your
questions answered. Show up at the beginning of the session, submit your
questions via the chat function, and we will take questions in order of
submission.

Before attending. You should attend the session on 10/26 or watch the
current video on industry careers for scientists on the OITE YouTube
page.  [https://www.youtube.com/c/NIHOITE][1]
