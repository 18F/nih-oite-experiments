Application season is in full swing.  Maybe you are disappointed about
interviews.  Maybe you are disappointed about test scores.  Let's talk
about how to make decisions about your next move and how to move
forward.   

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive methods to build resilience and
self-care skills.  Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than not attend at all.
