Medical Science Liaison (MSL) is one of the most interesting careers in
medical affairs within the life science for people with advanced degrees
(MD/PhD). MSL plays a fundamental role in the pharmaceutical and
healthcare industries, 'helping bridge the communication between
clinical development and commercial success.' The panelists have
experience working in pharmaceutical companies and will help you learn
more about this fascinating career by sharing their career path and
discussing transitioning from academia to an MSL position.

This event is sponsored by the NIH FelCom Career Development
Subcommittee. A written summary of the session will be posted for
fellows who are unable to attend.
