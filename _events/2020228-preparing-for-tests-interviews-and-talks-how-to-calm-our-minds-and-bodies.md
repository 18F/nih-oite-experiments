Does your anxiety keep you from performing your best on tests,
interviews, and during lab talks? Does it seem like no matter how well
prepared you are, your nervous system gets overwhelmed on the day of the
event and you can\'t think straight or clearly?

This session gives you basic instructions on how to use stress to your
advantage; how to transform your \"sticking thinking\" to \"healthy and
positive thinking\"; how to keep calm and clear and how to perform up to
your full potential.
