**ROOM CHANGE TO LIPSETT**

In this highly interactive workshop we will share advice and strategies
for interviewing successfully for positions in non-academic sectors
(industry, non-profit, government, etc) that PhD scientists will apply
for.  This seminar will not cover academic tenure track interviews, that
workshop will be on January 5, 2011.  Please register for that session
separtately.

Topics will include interviewing skills, meeting interviewers\'
expectations, answering common questions, communicating responses with
confidence, and preparing effectively for the interview. 

This seminar is NOT intended to help you prepare for graduate/medical
school interviews.  Resources for these types of interviews can be found
elsewhere on the OITE website.
