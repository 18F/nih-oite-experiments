discoveries can make an impact worldwide through international
collaborations and global health organizations.  If you would like to
learn more about some of the organizations that form international
partnerships through scientific collaborations, then please attend the
FelCom event, \"Careers in Science Diplomacy and International
Science.\"  We will be hosting a panel of speakers from a variety of
organizations including the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the International Food Policy Research Institute,
and the U.S. Department of State.  The panelists will discuss how they
transitioned into their current positions, the pros and cons of their
job responsibilities, and the skills you can acquire if you are
interested in pursuing a career in international science. Please join us
for an exciting discussion.</span>

This event is sponsored by the NIH FelCom Career Development
Subcommittee.
