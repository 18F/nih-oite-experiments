During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the academic advising team will
answer questions about the academic faculty careers, applications, and
other general questions. 

This is not a workshop, but a chance for you to drop-in and get your
questions answered. Show up at the beginning of the session, submit your
questions via the chat function, and we will take questions in order of
submission.

You should (in fact you must) watch the current video on applying for
faculty positions (with a discussion of how the pandemic is influencing
faculty
hiring) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6hVk159TuA&amp;list=PLxnpU66KqCchiTt7HL8kHF8GN4Gi17nni&amp;index=3][1]

Register here, and we will share the zoom link the day of the event.
