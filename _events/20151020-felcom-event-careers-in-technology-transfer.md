curious about the process of transitioning from bench work to the
exciting field of technology transfer? Are you interested in protecting
cutting edge technologies through patents and copyrights? If so, then
this is the career panel for you! The FelCom Career Development
subcommittee has put together a fantastic panel of Ph.D.-level
scientists who have made the transition to working in various areas
within the field of technology transfer.  The panelists will discuss
their areas of expertise, day-to-day routines, how they landed their
current positions, the differences between working for universities and
private firms, and advice for post-docs about preparing for a career in
technology transfer.  Additionally, there will be a social networking
event immediately following the seminar. Come and join the discussion
with our \"Careers in Technology Transfer\" panel to see if a job in
this field is right for you!</span>
