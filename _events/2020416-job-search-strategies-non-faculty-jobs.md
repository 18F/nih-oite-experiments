A job search involves more than just applying to job postings.
Successful job searches require planning. You will need to complete four
key activities: building a productive network, creating resumes that
work for you, establishing search strategies for finding jobs, and
preparing for a competitive interview. This session examines the job
search as a process that integrates those four key activities to launch
an effective job search. We will cover jobs choices in all sectors
(non-profits, government, industry, and non-faculty academic jobs)
