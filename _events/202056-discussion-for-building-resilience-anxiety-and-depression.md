<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

the causes and the symptoms of anxiety are a bit more difficult to
pinpoint.  Anxiety may cause feelings of inner turmoil and worry that
may manifest into physical symptoms, interfere with functioning, and
have other impacts including, sometimes depression. Alternatively,
depression may also lead to increased anxiety and ultimately to feeling
so overwhelmed that it gets in the way of being able to
function. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

Advisor, Liann Seiter.  The discussion group provides a confidential and
welcoming space to explore positive and proactive methods to build
resilience and self-care skills with other trainees having similar
experiences.  Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  </span>
