Learn and practice about how to answer the interview question, \"Tell me
about yourself\". This question is asked in almost every interview
situation; industry, academic jobs, and interviews for graduate and

Designed as a quick talk, there will be a 15 minute discussion on the
topic...then we will go to breakout rooms to practice.
