Note new time to accommodate the NIH Town Hall

This experiential and engaging course, rooted in psychological type and
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment, explores themes of
self-awareness and self-management.  Through exercises, lecture, and
small group discussions, you learn about and validate your own type
preferences and work and communication styles.   We will also focus on
the particular challenges of communication, different learning and
teaching styles, and the different influencing and interaction styles
you encounter in any research group or workgroup.   

This workshop combines the first two session in our Workplace Dynamics
Series.  Fellows who attend all sessions will earn a certificate. 
Please note that this session has been offered in the past, and earlier
attendance will count towards your certificate.
