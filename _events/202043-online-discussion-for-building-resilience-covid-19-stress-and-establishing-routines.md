<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

to increased stress and worry for many. Loss of our daily routines can
further contribute to feeling unsettled and even overwhelmed. During
times like these it is not uncommon to experience changes in mood or
motivation that can leave us feeling less productive and engaged in
meaningful activities. This discussion will focus on finding ways to
encourage and support each other as we work to build back routine in our
daily lives.</span>

Laurie Chaikind McNulty. The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
