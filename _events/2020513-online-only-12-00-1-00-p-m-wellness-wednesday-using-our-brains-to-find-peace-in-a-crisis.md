During this stressful time, it can be hard to manage the emotional
challenges of sheltering in place and facing an uncertain future. We
can't rely on some of our usual ways of coping, like going out on the
town with friends or getting hugs from someone. That means many of us
are falling back on the (healthy or not-so-healthy) mental habits that
we've been building up for years.  According to Rick Hanson,
psychologist and neuroscience expert, the coronavirus crisis is exposing
some of our psychological vulnerabilities and reminding us how important
it is to nurture our social and emotional strengths.  He identifies
seven qualities available to all of us that are at the heart of
resilient wellbeing.  Curious about what these are?  Come join us on
Zoom this Wellness Wednesday to talk about **Using Our Brains to Find
Peace in a Crisis**.
