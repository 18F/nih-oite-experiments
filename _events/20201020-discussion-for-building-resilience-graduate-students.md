This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our graduate

Your years in graduate school can be an exciting time of personal growth
and development. They can also be a frustrating and difficult time.
Often, pursuing a graduate degree is simultaneously challenging and
rewarding. As a grad student at NIH, you are concurrently balancing
research, managing a relationship between your university and NIH,
writing a dissertation, and trying to figure out how to tell your PI
that you want to graduate. Between worrying about moving your project
forward, balancing work and life, making career decisions, finding time
to address career development needs, and interpersonal issues with
mentors, mentees, and labmates, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and
disconnected. Recent events have added uncertainty about when you can
complete your projects and when you will reach the next milestone. Join
us for a chance to discuss the unique challenges you face as a graduate
student.

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.
