It is common for scientists to present their research findings to the
peers at scientific poster sessions. Postbac Poster Day, held in the
Natcher Conference Center in May provides the opportunity for NIH
postbacs present their research.  This workshop will help prepare you
for Poster Day or any other opportunity you have to present your work in
poster format. The workshop will focus on selecting and organizing data,
the key sections of a successful poster, layout and font selection, and
poster presentation techniques.

NOTE: Graduate students and Postdocs are also welcome.
