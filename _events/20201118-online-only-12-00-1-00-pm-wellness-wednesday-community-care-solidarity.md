Each of us carry intersecting identities that can be impacted by
sociopolitical climates. These identities can carry privilege(s) or
result in vulnerabilities. Despite these privileges and vulnerabilities,
we are a part of communities that that can offer us care and support.
During this Wellness Wednesday, we will discuss how we can foster
communities of care that support our wellness and explore how you can be
in solidarity with other communities to provide support.
