<span style="font-size: 10pt;">As the winter approaches, the colder
weather, shorter days, and social distancing will begin to present us
with new challenges for our wellness. Additionally, the persistent
feelings of uncertainty about the future continues to trouble many of
us. Just as we were beginning to develop some semblance of a routine and
learning to cope with this uncertainty, Covid winter may disrupt those
routines and coping tools. This discussion will focus on how
to reevaluate coping tools for the winter and continued
uncertainty.   </span>

Wellness Advisor, Liann Seiter. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
