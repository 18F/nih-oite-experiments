Please join us for a virtual lunch meeting on **Friday, April
3rd** from **12:00 pm to 1:00 pm**. It may be easy to feel isolated
during this time, so take advantage of this opportunity to meet other
members, enjoy lunch together, and get to know our community. This will
be a chance to talk about particular challenges you may be facing as a
result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, social distancing,
teleworking, or any of the other recent changes to our lives.

The mission of this group is to foster a community of awareness and
support for individuals of all abilities, including people with
emotional/cognitive or physical disabilities or with chronic illnesses
and their allies. We hope to discuss issues unique to individuals of all
abilities both within and outside of science. We will hold monthly
bring-your-own lunch gatherings to share concerns about and strategies
for navigating the intersection of science and ability. Dates and places
are currently discussed. Please join our listserv to learn more about
our upcoming monthly meetings.

To become a member of the network, please [join the
NIH-FAAB listserv][1]. If you have additional questions,
contact <a>Laura Marler</a>, the OITE advisor to FAAb.
