New research findings are communicated to the scientific community via
scientific papers, and being able to read these papers and make use of
the information they contain is key to successful research. However,
reading a scientific paper can be extremely challenging for students who
don\'t have much experience with it. This session will teach you how to
get the most out of each paper you read. Questions addressed will
include:

* Why do scientists read papers?
* How do you decide which papers to read?
* How can you most efficiently find the important information in each
  paper?
* How do you critically evaluate a paper?
