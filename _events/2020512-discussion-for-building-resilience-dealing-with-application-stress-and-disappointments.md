and frustration for many of us. Maybe you are disappointed about
interviews.  Maybe you are disappointed about testing. Or maybe you are
stressed about the uncertainty of how things will unfold.  Let's talk
about how to make decisions about your next move and how to move
forward.   </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive methods to build resilience and
self-care skills.  Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  </span>
