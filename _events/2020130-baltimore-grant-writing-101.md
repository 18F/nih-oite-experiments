**This session is in Baltimore, MD**

This introduction to grant writing is largely focused on NIH grants.
Topics include: finding funding opportunities, the submission and review
process, the inner workings of study sections, and planning and writing
grants, including the major sections of a grant, tips for success, and
reading and responding to summary statements. This workshop is intended
to provide the background fellows need to begin crafting a grant
application; it does not involve written assignments or feedback on
drafts of applications.
