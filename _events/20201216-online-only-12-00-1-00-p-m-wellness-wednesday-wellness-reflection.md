*Whether it be the decrease in productivity, re-evaluating professional
goals, coping with grief and loss, or missing our loved ones, 2020 has
provided us with many challenges that have impacted us personally and
professionally. In preparation for 2021, this Wellness Wednesday we will
begin to reflect upon the challenges that each of us have faced in
maintaining our wellness, explore insights that we have developed, and
consider where we want to go with our wellness journey.*
