<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17.8329830169678px;">As
scientists, it is important that we engage in outreach efforts to get
people excited about science and to educate the public about current
issues in biomedical research.  If you enjoy being involved in outreach
events and would like to learn more about careers in science outreach,
please attend the FelCom Career Development Seminar on November 18.  A
panel of speakers from a variety of settings will discuss their career
trajectories, their daily activities, and the pros and cons of their
current positions.  Come learn how you can apply your scientific
expertise to reach out to the community!</span>

*This event is sponsored by the NIH FelCom Career Development
Subcommittee.*
