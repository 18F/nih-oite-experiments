There is currently a lot happening both here and in the world.  The
constant barrage of information from social media and news can be
overwhelming.  Add to that the frustration of not feeling in control and
the anxiety about what the future may bring can be very stressful,
particularly when friends and family live far away.  

Please join us on for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than to not attend at all.
