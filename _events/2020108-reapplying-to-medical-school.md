If you anticipate reapplying to MD or MD/PhD programs, it will be
important to submit a substantially revised application.  In this
workshop, Dr. John Taborn will help you to get in the mindset to
reapply, learn how to analyze the application that you submitted
previously, and to create a plan for moving forward successfully.  
Please attend this workshop if you have applied to MD or MD/PhD programs
in the past or are currently applying and

* you haven't heard from schools about interviews; or
* you interviewed, are awaiting a response ; or
* you were waitlisted but haven\'t been moved up; or
* just want to be prepared should you need to re-apply
