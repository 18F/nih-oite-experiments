<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">While we are
currently under stay-at-home orders, many are looking ahead to the
stressors of re-entering the workplace. You may be concerned about
increasing your risk for contracting and/or spreading COVID-19. You may
also be worried about having conversations with people in your lab
regarding when and how the lab will manage the timing for work reentry
and safety procedures that will be put in place. The sudden stop in your
current project may have led to a significant loss in resources and a
lapse in data collection; you may feel overwhelmed at the tasks related
to restarting your research.</span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Jonah Green The discussion
group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore positive
and proactive ways to plan for re-entry to work. </span>
