<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This session is
only for NIH Intramural Trainees.  This online session will be held with
Zoom.  The meeting link will be distributed via the NIH Trainee
Listservs. If you need the link immediately please email
maria.gutierrez2@nih.gov.</span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join
this warm and welcoming group of LGBTQI+ trainees to enjoy a safe space
and be yourself. Let's share our unique resources, experiences and
challenges to help you feel connected and supported during your time as
an NIH trainee. Whether you are feeling isolated, unsure or just want to
expand your community, this LGBTQI+ group is for you.  Labels are less
important than your feeling connected to our community; come join us
wherever you are on your own personal journey. This session is open to
trainees at all levels (postbac, grad, and postdoc).</span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Lissa Mantell.  The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care skills.
Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to
still attend. </span>
