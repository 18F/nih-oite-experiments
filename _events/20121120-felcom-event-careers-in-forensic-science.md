Have you ever wondered if you could apply your science background to
solve the next big murder mystery? Or maybe you want to view molecular
science from an \"in-the-field\" perspective? If so, then this is the
panel to attend!  Forensic science interfaces with nearly every facet of
our community:  healthcare, criminal justice, biological weapons and
defense.  This panel will explore careers in forensic science at both
government and non-government institutions. With speakers from a variety
of backgrounds, attendees will learn about the diverse opportunities
within this field as well as the entry requirements for available
careers. This event is sponsored by FELCOM\'s Career Development
Subcommittee.

This event will not be videocast, but a write-up of the information
presented in the seminar will be available on the OITE website
approximately one month after the event.
