<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica,

have led to greatly increased stress and worry for many of us.  Many of
us are struggling with the uncertainty of what the future will bring. 
Our carefully planned projects and timelines are being forced to change
and we have no control over the outcome.  Loss of our daily routines can
further contribute to feeling unsettled and even overwhelmed. This
discussion will focus on finding ways to encourage and support each
other as we navigate through this uncertain time.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica,

Laurie Chaikind McNulty. The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
