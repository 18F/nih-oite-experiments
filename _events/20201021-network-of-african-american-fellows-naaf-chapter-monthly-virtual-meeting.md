Please join the Network of African American Fellows (NAAF) for our
monthly chapter virtual meeting. This month's meeting will be the first
in a series providing various ways to stay involved with the NIH and
research. Dr. Kristi Porter, the director of recruitment and student
affairs for the NIH Oxford Cambridge Program and the NIH MD/PhD Program,
will be joining us to provide details about the programs and the
application process. Come ready with all of your questions about the
elements that constitute a strong application as you prepare for the
next steps in your career.

The zoom link will be sent prior to the meeting to the listserv.
