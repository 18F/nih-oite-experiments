Traditional journal publishing: Instead of trying the spaghetti-sticking
approach or impact factors, let's talk about the best ways to identify a
journal for your manuscript, and then how to navigate the submission
process. We will look at several levels of journals and discuss
pros/cons of each, along with the hidden importance of cover letters and
how to appeal decisions you don't agree with.
