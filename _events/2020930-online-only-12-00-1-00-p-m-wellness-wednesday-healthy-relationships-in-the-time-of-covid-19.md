*COVID-19 has presented us with many challenges. In addition to
minimizing exposure to the contagion, social distancing has presented us
with unique experiences within our interpersonal relationships. Join us
as we explore developing creative ways to combat loneliness, setting
healthy boundaries, and learning effective communication skills in the
virtual world.*
