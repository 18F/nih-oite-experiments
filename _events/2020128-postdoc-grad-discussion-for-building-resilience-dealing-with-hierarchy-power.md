Do you sometimes feel like your lack of power as a trainee influences
your ability to succeed?  Maybe the organizational structure of your
program or research group makes you feel like your voice doesn\'t
count.  Join us in this session to talk about this challenge common to
many trainees.  

Building your resiliency and self-care skills now will help you to
successfully navigate through periods of growth, and will serve you well
throughout your academic and career path. The discussion group provides
a confidential and welcoming environment with other postdocs and grads
having similar experiences. Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. Even if you can't join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come
late or leave early, than not attend at all.
