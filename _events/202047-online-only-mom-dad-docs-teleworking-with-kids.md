Teleworking with kids is a new experience for all of us. What are the
best strategies to occupy them while we try to get our own work done?
How do we manage our time to accomplish our to-do-lists for work, give
attention to the kids, and manage housework? What options do I have for
home schooling? What can toddlers do, while I am on the computer? How do
I avoid screen time for the kids?

All these are questions we are pondering in these uncertain times
staying at home. During the next weeks we will be offering an online
platform to discuss these questions, develop strategies to cope and
built community. Please see below the login in information for the
meetings, which will be held every Tuesday from noon - 1:00 pm.

Please join our meeting from your computer, tablet or smartphone.

What is Mom-Dad-Docs? The mission of this group is to provide a
supportive community for postdoc, clinical fellow and graduate student
parents at the NIH. This group will discuss and address issues and
challenges of juggling parenthood and a scientific career at the same
time. Monthly meetings will alternate between in-person discussions and
webinars to provide postdoc/clinical fellow/graduate student parents a
chance to meet while learning more about topics such as time management,
career, and general parenting questions. Guest speakers will present
topics, insights and resources. The Mom-Dad-Docs group welcomes all male
and female post-docs, clinical fellows, trainees, graduate students and
mentors with children (or thinking about having children).Â
