*Research tells us that being in nature can help us improve our mood and
reduce our feelings of stress. As the fall season sets in, do you have
questions about how can you still be active outdoors and embrace nature?
This Wellness Wednesday we explore how you can use your relationship to
nature to improve your health and shape your environmental wellness.*
