<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

Applying and interviewing for graduate and professional schools can be
extremely stressful in the best of circumstances.  Juggling both the
application process and pandemic changes is especially challenging. 
Uncertain changes and virtual interviews add another level of complexity
to an already stressful process.  </span>
