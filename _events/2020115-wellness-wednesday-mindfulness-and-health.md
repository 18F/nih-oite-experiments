Mindfulness -- or "paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in
the present moment, non-judgmentally" -- is a practice that allow us to
be more fully present and engaged in our lives.  Research is also
showing many benefits of mindfulness for both our physical and mental
health and wellbeing, including reducing the impact of stress, lowering
depression and anxiety, helping with weight loss, supporting a healthy
gut microbiome, among others.  Come to *Wellness Wednesday* this week
and learn about how to incorporate mindfulness into your everyday life
and reap some of these benefits!  **Feel free to bring your lunch --
microwave is available!**
