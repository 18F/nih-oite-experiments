**Direct Foreign Awards to NIH Funded Trainees from Low- and
Middle-Income Countries**

The Global Research Initiative Program for New Investigators (GRIP) was
established in 2002 by FIC, together with NCI, NIDA, NEI, NIA NIBIB,
NIEHS, NINDS, NIGMS, ODS, OBSSR, and ORWH to promote productive re-entry
of NIH-trained foreign investigators from [Low- and Middle-Income
Countries][1] (LMIC) into their home countries upon completion of their
training.   With GRIP research experience, it is expected that awardees
would be prepared to pursue independent research careers that would
benefit the awardees themselves, their home institutions, the global
research community, and specifically address the health priorities of
their home countries. 

The GRIP program uses the R01 funding mechanism and gives an award of up
to $50,000 a year for up to 5 years for a new investigator from a LMIC
who has been trained through Fogarty training programs or through
training at the NIH in the intramural research programs of various
Institutes and Centers. The program accepts application once a year and
includes both biomedical research and behavioral and social sciences
research.
