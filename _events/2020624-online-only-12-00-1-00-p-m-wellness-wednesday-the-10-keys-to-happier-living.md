Happiness is something we all strive for, but it can often prove
illusive - especially in difficult times like the one we are
experiencing now. Furthermore, everyone's path to happiness is
different, but research suggests there are **"10 Keys to
Happiness" **that consistently tend to have a positive impact on
people's overall happiness and well-being. The first five (*GREAT*)
relate to how we interact with the outside world in our daily
activities. The second five (*DREAM*) come more from inside us and
depend on our attitude to life. Curious about what *G.R.E.A.T.
D.R.E.A.M.* stands for?  Come to Wellness Wednesday this week and find
out!
