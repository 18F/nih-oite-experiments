We have an inborn capacity for wonder and awe, which science has
identified as being very beneficial for us. Yet modern life often
hinders this natural trait.  We are flooded every day with
"fast-breaking news" - and these days, the news is frequently awful
rather than awe-inspiring! It can be challenging to find a moment to
pause and be amazed by life within and around us.  But in these waning
days of 2020, tapping into the wonder and awe of life is a gift we can
give ourselves and others. Come to this week's Wellness Wednesday to
talk about this special wellness strategy.
