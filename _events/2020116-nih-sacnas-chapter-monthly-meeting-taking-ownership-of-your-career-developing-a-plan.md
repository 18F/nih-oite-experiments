The NIH-SACNAS Chapter (Society for the Advancement of
Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science) would like to invite
you to their next meeting. This month\'s meeting will focus on creating
an Individual Development Plan.

Do you have a career plan? Do you know if you have the required skills
for your dream job? Figuring out the next step in your career and how to
prepare for it can be stressful. But developing a plan early on in your
career will help you get to where you want to go. Please join Dr.
Patricia Sokolove, Deputy Director, OITE, to talk about establishing
goals, enhancing your professional skills, and implementing your plan.

Everyone is welcome!
