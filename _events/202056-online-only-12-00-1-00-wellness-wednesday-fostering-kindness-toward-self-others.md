We all know it feels good when we receive kindness, but did you know it
can be equally great (or even better) to extend it to ourselves or
others? Some of the benefits of practicing kindness include the release
of feel-good hormones, reduction in levels of anxiety, increased health
protection for your physical heart, and more stability and satisfaction
in relationships, among others.  It is particularly important to
practice kindness during this difficult time. This *Wellness Wednesday*
will focus on ways we can F**oster Kindness Toward Self &amp; Others**.
So come talk with others on Zoom about how we can all spread a little
kindness!
