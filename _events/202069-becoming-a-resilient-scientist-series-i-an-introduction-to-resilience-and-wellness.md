We all experience setback and disappointments in school, work and life.
In this webinar we will look at seven key elements of resilience with a
focus on building habits that promote healthier responses and resilient
behaviors in the face of set-back in educational and work environments.

## Becoming a Resilient Scientist Series (9 weeks)

Navigating school, the career exploration process, research
environments, and the stress of national/international news can seem
overwhelming and lead us to doubt ourselves just when we need confidence
the most. Through workshops and group discussions in this series, we
will work to identify attitudes and behaviors that can help us be more
resilient as we navigate difficult situations in school, work and life.
Each workshop will highlight emotional intelligence competencies needed
for success in research and healthcare careers and will provide
strategies for developing these competencies as part of your educational
journey. While you may participate in any of webinars, it is best to
participate in the entire series as the material relates and concepts
will be developed throughout the series. The five workshops and four
group discussions in the series are:

Week 1 -- 6/9/2020: I. An Introduction to Resilience and Wellness
