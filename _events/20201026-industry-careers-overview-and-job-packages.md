A key difference between industry and academia is that in industry you
are expected to produce something of value to your company and the
shareholders - this is the business side of science.  A PhD scientist
can assume numerous roles in an industry setting including technology
management, business development, project management, marketing,
technical sales, regulatory affairs, quality control, quality assurance,
technical support, patents, financial analysis, human resource
recruitment, medical science relationship building, clinical research
management, and corporate communications.  This session will highlight
these career opportunities and provide insight into how to position
yourself (including building your resume and cover letters) to be
competitive for these jobs.

The session will be on the gotowebinar
platform: [https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3912723587187259150][1]
