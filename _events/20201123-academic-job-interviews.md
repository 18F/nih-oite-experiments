After you submit your academic job package, the job interview is the
next major hurdle to securing a position. In this workshop, learn the
\"do\'s and don\'ts\" of academic job interviewing and hear what
interview committees like to see. In addition, the workshop will address
job talks, chalk talks and teaching talks - important elements of many
academic job interviews.

The session will be on the gotowebinar
