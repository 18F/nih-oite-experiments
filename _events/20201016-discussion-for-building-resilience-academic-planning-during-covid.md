<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The pandemic has brought many changes to
the current application season.  Not only are these changes beyond our
control, but the uncertainty of how they will impact our carefully made
plans for applying to grad or professional school and ultimately
reaching our career goals can be stressful.  As we ponder how events
will unfold, we may need to consider making changes to our plans and
goals.  Making decisions about your next steps and how to move forward
may seem daunting.  You are not alone. Join us and connect with others
going through a similar experience.   </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates.  The discussion group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive methods to
build resilience and self-care skills.  Even if you can\'t join us for
the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
