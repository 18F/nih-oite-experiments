Communication is a skill vital to any scientific career. Science writing
plays an integral part in supporting novel scientific research and
advancing the socio-political conversations in STEM fields. To learn
about the broad range of careers in this field, we invite scientists
from government, academic and pharmaceutical sectors who have
successfully built their careers in science writing. The panelists will
share their stories about career transition, day-to-day experiences and
challenges in different settings. After the presentations, our panelists
will be happy to answer questions and provide career advice on how to
become a professional communicator. Come and join us to learn more about
those fascinating careers and find your future aspirations. This event
is sponsored by FELCOM's Career Development Subcommittee.

This event is sponsored by the NIH FelCom Career Development
Subcommittee.
