Have you been interested in the process of transitioning from bench work
to working within the federal government? Are curious about the
procedure of applying for government jobs? If so, then this is the
career panel for you! The FelCom Career Development subcommittee has put
together a fantastic panel of Ph.D.-level scientists who have made the
transition to working in various areas within the federal government.Â 
The panelists will discuss their day-to-day routine, likes, dislikes,
and how they landed their current position. Additionally, there will be
a social networking event immediately following the seminar. Come and
join the discussion with our \"Careers in Government\" panel.
