Do you ever feel like your phone is like another appendage of your body
-- a sort of "third arm?"  Do you feel anxious when you accidently leave
it at home (<em>if </em>that ever happens)? Can you imagine being
without it for a day? Or even an hour? This week's *Wellness Wednesday*
will focus on the impact of being "plugged in" 24/7 on our health and
wellbeing -- and will share research on the effects of having our phones
nearby when trying to complete a cognitive task (like studying for the
MCAT or any other important task).  **Feel Free to bring your lunch --
microwave is available!**
