Our bodies are hard-wired to react instantaneously to any perceived
threat as part of an evolutionary survival mechanism.  The problem with
this in 2020 is that we can fall into a \"fight, flight, or freeze\"
reaction in circumstances that are not about survival at all but are
only everyday stressors.  Over time, this can lead to being on
\"hyperarousal\" as our default mode, bringing with it several physical
and emotional health issues.  The current climate is making this even
more likely for many of us.  Come to Wellness Wednesday this week to
talk about how we can learn to mindfully **respond vs. react** to stress
in our lives and the benefits of doing so!
