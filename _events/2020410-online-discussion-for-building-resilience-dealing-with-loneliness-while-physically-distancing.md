will be held online via Zoom.  The link will be distributed in NIH
Trainee Listserv announcements.</span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Current events
may have left you feeling physically and emotionally isolated from your
families, friends, and communities.  It's possible that you're living
alone and missing the company of others.  Or maybe you're experiencing
an increase in conflict with roommates or family as you spend much more
time together. It is quite common to experience changes in mood and
feelings of sadness and loneliness when you are physically distant from
those you care about or arguing more with people in your home.  As
social beings, while we might benefit from our alone time, we do require
connection with others to thrive. Join us as we discuss coping with the
challenges of increased solitude and roommate conflict and explore how
we can take care of ourselves and each other during this time. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin Futrovsky. The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.</span>
