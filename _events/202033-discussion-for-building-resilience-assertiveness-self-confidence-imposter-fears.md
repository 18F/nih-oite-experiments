Sometimes asking for what we need in an assertive and confident manner
can be difficult, especially if we are also experiencing negative
thoughts about our accomplishments and capabilities.  At times, our
inner voice causes many of us to feel less confident and knowledgeable
than we really are - - so we feel like an imposter.  If you ever feel
like you have a great suggestion for improving efficiency in your lab
but lack the confidence to bring it to the attention of your PI;  or
when you need additional resources for your experiments or time off for
an important family activity but don\'t know how to ask, this session
will help you to explore strategies for facing and minimizing negative
thoughts, identifying positive qualities, and communicating your needs
in a more assertive and confident manner.  This session is open to
trainees at all levels (postbac, grad, and postdoc).

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.  We would rather you come late or leave
early, than not attend at all.
