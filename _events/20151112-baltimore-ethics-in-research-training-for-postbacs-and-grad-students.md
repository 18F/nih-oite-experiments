\"The public trust in what we do is just essential, and we cannot afford
to take any chances with the integrity of the research process.\" - Dr.
Francis Collins, Director, NIH  
  
Training in Responsible Conduct of Research is an essential component of
your development as a scientist.

The news is full of reports about scientific misconduct and its profound
consequences. The NIH has now created a course specifically for postbacs
and grad students to ensure that you have the foundation to conduct
rigorous and ethical research.\*

This course will use lectures, group discussions, and case studies to
explore the principles of research ethics. The full-day course is split
into a morning and afternoon session (attendance at both is required for
course credit.) Each class accommodates 50 people. Certificates will be
awarded to those that complete the course.

Morning session: The Principles of Research Ethics.

* Overview of research ethics (current topics and historical studies)
* Formal research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, and
  plagiarism)
* Ethical research involving animal models and human subjects

Afternoon session: Ethics in Action.

* Data management
* Mentor/mentee relations
* Conflict of Interest
* Conflict resolution and reporting
* Strategies for exceling as a trainee in an ethical manner

\*This course is only for postbacs and grad students.  Postdocs should
talk to their training director for ethics training.  You can find your
