This one-day training program is designed for NIH summer interns with
little or no prior research experience. Come develop the skills you need
to be successful in science! Get acquainted with NIH research culture.
 Learn about different tools and techniques commonly used in research. 
Discuss how to approach a research project and what makes a good
research question. And, get useful and practical tips on giving group
meeting, keeping a notebook, and reading scientific papers. Taught by
Dr. Phil Ryan with help from NIH postdocs, workshops will include both
lecture and interactive activities.

NOTE:  if you already have research experience, but are new to the NIH,
the first session of Boot Camp serves as an orientation to the NIH.  You
may register for just the first session by sending an e-mail to Dr. Phil
Ryan at [ryanp@mail.nih.gov](mailto:ryanp@mail.nih.gov) with the subject
line - Baltimore Boot Camp Orientation.
