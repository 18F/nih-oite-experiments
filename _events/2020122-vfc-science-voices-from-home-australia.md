Bios:  
**Katie Day**   
Katie is a Research Scientist II at Vow, a Sydney-based biotech startup

submitted her PhD thesis through the NIH-Cambridge Scholars Program.
During her PhD, she spent two years at NIAMS working with Dr. Mariana
Kaplan and two years at the University of Cambridge working with Prof
Edwin Chilvers. Her thesis focuses on the relationship between
neutrophil biophysical properties and immune function in the context of
systemic lupus erythematosus and included collaborators at NHLBI, NIBIB
and the NIAMS light imaging section. Katie also worked closely with
ZellMechanik Dresden, a biotech company based in Germany which develops
real-time deformability cytometry for high-throughput
mechanophenotyping. Katie moved to Australia in March 2020, and has been
enjoying hiking in the Blue Mountains and visiting Sydney\'s gorgeous
beaches.

She was awarded her PhD from The University of Melbourne in 2014. Dr.
Turbitt's research lies at the intersection of genomics, decision making

aspects of genomics, with a focus on how families affected by genetic
disorders cope and make decisions about healthcare and their involvement
in research.
