The FARE2016 application is open.  All eligible postdocs, research
fellows, clinical fellows, and grad students are encouraged to apply.
 But a FARE abstract is not the same as a conference abstract. It needs
to appeal to a wider audience. To help you with writing a FARE abstract,
Dr. Michelle Jobes, a 3-time FARE winner, will lead a webinar for NIH
fellows applying for FARE.   
  
Topics covered will be:   
• How are FARE abstracts different from typical abstracts?   
• How are FARE abstracts judged?   
• What makes a FARE abstract standout to the judges?   
• Can you create a FARE abstract from an abstract you\'ve already
written? (yes!)   
• What do FARE winners receive?  

OITE webinars have a two-step registration preocess.  First, please
